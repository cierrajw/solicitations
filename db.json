"topic_description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\r\n\r\nThe NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate the lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives and Scope\r\n\r\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews or other procedures of clinical research; however, applications that propose to conduct intervention studies will not be considered responsive to the FOA and will not be reviewed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\r\n\r\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\r\n\r\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\r\n\r\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\r\n\r\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\r\n\r\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics\r\n\r\nCollaboration between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\r\n\r\nCommercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers, especially women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons, to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\r\n\r\nMilestone\r\n\r\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives, in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.",

"topic_description": "The educational objective of this FOA is to provide opportunities for eligible SBCs to submit NIH SBIR grant applications to develop IDM STEM products that address student career choice and health and medicine topics for: (1) pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12) students and teachers or (2) informal science education (ISE) audiences. The second educational objective is to inform the American public that their quality of health is defined by lifestyle. If this message is understood, people can begin to live longer and reduce the healthcare burden to society. Therefore, this FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. The research objective of this FOA is the development of new educational products that will advance our understanding of how IDM STEM-based gaming can improve student learning. It is anticipated that increasing underserved and minority student achievement in STEM fields through IDM STEM resources will encourage these students to pursue health-related careers that will increase their economic and social opportunities. A diverse health care workforce will help to expand health care access for the underserved, foster research in neglected areas of societal need, and enrich the pool of managers and policymakers to meet the needs of a diverse population.\r\n\r\nIDM is a bridge technology that converts game-based activities from a social pastime to a powerful educational tool that challenges students with problem solving, conceptual reasoning and goal-oriented decision making. Well-designed IDM products mimic successful teacher pedagogy and exploit student interest in games for learning. IDM STEM products also integrate imbedded learning, e.g., what the student knows and new knowledge gained in the gaming process, into problem solving skills. IDM products provide real time student assessment. Unlike standardized classroom testing where student achievement is a pass or fail process, IDM-based assessment is interactive, does not punish the student, and provides feedback on how to move to the next level of play. IDM products are intended to generate long-term changes in student performance, educational outcomes and career choices.\r\n\r\nThis FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. Types of applications submitted to this FOA may vary with the target audience, scientific content, educational purpose and method of delivery. IDM STEM products may include but are not limited to: game-based curricula, resources that promote attitude changes toward learning, new skills development, teamwork and group activities, public participation in scientific research (citizen science) projects, and behavioral changes in lifestyle and health. IDM STEM products designed to increase the number of underserved students, e.g., American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, disabled, or otherwise underrepresented individuals considering careers in basic, behavioral or clinical research are encouraged.\r\n\r\nIDM STEM products may be designed for use in-classroom or out-of-classroom settings, e.g., as supplements to existing classroom curricula, for after-school science clubs, libraries, hospital waiting rooms and science museums. IDM products may target children in group settings or individually, with or without adult or teacher participation or supervision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project may use any IDM gaming technology or platform but the platform chosen should be accessible to the target group.\r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "Background\r\n\r\nThe Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative is a Presidential project aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. It is expected that the application of these new tools and technologies will ultimately lead to new ways to identify, treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.\r\n\r\nNIH is one of several federal agencies involved in the BRAIN Initiative. Planning for the NIH component of the BRAIN initiative is guided by the long-term scientific plan, \"BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision,\" which details seven high-priority research areas and calls for a sustained federal commitment of $4.5 billion over 12 years. This report can be found at http://braininitiative.nih.gov/. This FOA and other FOAs issued in Fiscal Year 2018 are based on NIH&#39;s careful consideration of the recommendations of the BRAIN 2025 Report, and input from the NIH BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the National BRAIN initiative, the NIH continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research and in technology development, including through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. \r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nBased on the priority areas identified by the BRAIN 2025, and in further evaluation of the neurotechnologies currently available to neuroscience researchers, it was determined that there is a need to enable broad dissemination of tools/technologies that improve our understanding of brain function. Many of these inventions require additional research and development (R&D) before they can be disseminated to the broader neuroscience community. To fill this research gap, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) which uses the STTR grant mechanism, will support to support the development of novel neuroscience tools and technologies in order to better understand the structure and function of brain circuits- a major goal of the BRAIN Initiative. This FOA will support further development of neurotechnologies developed through the BRAIN initiative or through other funding programs in preparation for commercial dissemination.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the activities proposed will require partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and Small Business Concerns (SBCs), which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple program directors/principal investigators. \r\n\r\nExamples of neurotechnologies that would be appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to, development of: \r\n\r\nWhile some of the markets for these products may be small, NIH is supportive of developing these technologies towards sustainable commercial manufacture. The full development and dissemination of these technologies will enable neuroscientists to perform novel hypothesis-driven experiments that are not feasible and/or reduce barriers to experiments that currently are too costly, difficult, or time consuming to perform broadly.   \r\n\r\nFor more information about neurotechnologies that may be of interest for this FOA, please see the BRAIN website:  https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/index.htm\r\n\r\nProjects with non-exempt human subjects research will not be supported by this FOA.

"topic_description": "Background\r\n\r\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to translate promising technologies and products to the private sector that align with their mission to improve health and save lives. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR program, as established by law and reauthorized under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834 and Public Law 115-232, is intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increase the private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal research and development funding; foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons. In addition, the STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their budget to SBIR, and those with research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside 0.45% of funds for STTR. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR/STTR program is a phased program. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. \r\n\r\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). \r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-20-261 or PA-20-265. \r\n\r\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  \r\n\r\nNIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH Direct to Phase II will accept Phase II submissions regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award. \r\n\r\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be a strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed SBIR Phase IIB project. Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, or a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants should provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details on any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors.\r\n\r\nNIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR FOA or other specific FOAs, are listed in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives\r\n\r\nThe PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In addition to the general SBIR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses. \r\n\r\nApplicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.\r\n\r\nAll applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement must propose clinical trial(s).

"topic_description": "\r\n\t\r\n\t\tRapid advances are being made in wearable technology, including clothing, jewelry and other devices with broadly diverse functions that meet medical or consumer needs.  This FOA seeks applications from small businesses that propose to design and produce a non-invasive wearable device to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time.\r\n\r\n\t\tAlcohol detection technology for personal alcohol monitoring has been successful in judicial and law enforcement settings, yet needs significant modification for wider use in other situations.  Current technological developments in electronics, miniaturization, wireless communication, and biophysical techniques of alcohol detection in humans increase the likelihood of successful development of a general use alcohol biosensor in the near future.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe alcohol biosensor device should be unobtrusive, appealing to the wearer, and can take the form of jewelry, clothing, or any other format located in contact with the human body. Techniques to quantitate alcohol in blood or interstitial fluid are highly encouraged. Highest priority will be given to technologies that depart from measuring alcohol in sweat or sweat vapor.  Applicants are encouraged to pursue any technology - including but not limited to biophysical, optical, wave, or other novel approaches- that works in a non-invasive way and can be incorporated into a wearable.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe device should be able to quantitate blood alcohol level, interpret, and store the data or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless transmission.  The device should have the ability to verify standardization at regular intervals and to indicate loss of functionality.  The power source should be dependable and rechargeable.  Data storage and transmission must be completely secure in order to protect the privacy of the individual.  A form of subject identification would be an added benefit.  The device can be removable. \r\n\r\n\t\tIt is envisioned that wearable alcohol monitors will serve useful purposes in research, clinical, and treatment settings, will play a role in public safety, and will be of interest to individuals interested in keeping track of personal health parameters. Designs may emphasize any of these potential market subsets or may seek to be broadly marketable.     \r\n\r\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

"topic_description": "\r\n\t\r\n\t\tFetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most widely used growth supplement for cell culture; it cost-effectively supports the survival, growth, and differentiation of many cell lines by providing nutrients, growth signals, and protection from stress. Although serum is an effective growth promoter, it is variable in its composition, activity, and effects on cellular phenotypes. This variability introduces inconsistencies into research using cultured cells. Sometimes it is possible to replicate experimental results only if the same manufacturer&#39;s serum is used; sometimes replication is only possible using serum from the same lot. Vendor literature and scientific reviews advise investigators to test lots of serum to identify those that support the desired cellular responses, and then buy a quantity of the best lot for long term use. This practice is widespread but can make replication of results by others difficult.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum contains hundreds, perhaps thousands, of constituents. These include macromolecules, small molecules, and trace elements; for any cell line a large and variable subset of these may be active in supporting cell growth. The composition and concentrations of factors in serum vary with the source animals&#39; diets, geographical locations, gestational stages, gender, health, season of harvesting, and histories of exposures to hormones, antibiotics, and environmental chemicals. Harvesting practices, manufacturing processes and additives, and differences in quality control and handling introduce additional variation. Serum is a byproduct of the meat-processing industry; dependence on serum is a barrier to translation of cell-based therapies because of the risk of transmission of viruses, prions, endotoxins, and immunogens.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum supplies factors that support cell growth through mechanisms that are not well understood, but includes hormones, enzymes, extracellular vesicles and proteins, extracellular matrix constituents, attachment and spreading factors, vitamins and minerals, trace elements, lipids, protease inhibitors, and other stabilizing and detoxifying factors. Substitute formulations for serum are expensive and time-consuming to develop and are cell-type specific; some cell lines cannot be grown with presently-available serum replacements. Although serum substitutes can support the growth of many cell types in culture, they often do not support robust survival and the same range of responses as does serum. Thus, serum continues to be widely used in many research settings where it is not economically practical to customize substitutes for it.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) addresses the needs of developers and users for supporting technologies and products to expedite (a) development of better serum substitutes, (b) identification of serum constituents that are effective in promoting the culture and responses of specific cell lines, and (c) troubleshooting of experimental variation stemming from variability in serum. This FOA will support SBIR projects to develop reliable and cost-effective tools; projects may develop new technologies or improve upon existing technologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSynthetic serum replacements, both general purpose and specialized for particular cell types. Development of minimal base formulations for customization by users into serum substitutes for specific cell lines.\r\n\t\t\tGeneral purpose analytical tools to detect constituents in serum. Tools for rapid evaluation of variation in serum composition, and for comparison of serum batches.\r\n\t\t\tSpecialized methods, tools and products for identification and evaluation of factors and activities in serum affecting adherence, survival and phenotypes of particular cell types.\r\n\t\t\tDevelopment of bioactive products for inclusion in serum replacements or to supplement reduced media, such as components that would assist the adherence of cells and promote correct morphology.\r\n\t\t\tAffordable methods for production of serum components such as growth factors.\r\n\t\t\tToolkits to assist users to develop serum replacements.\r\n\t\t\tMethods, tools, and products for detecting and clearing biological and chemical contaminants, such as viruses, prions, endotoxins, immunogens, etc.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

There is an analogous need to digitize similar\r\ntypes of analog data in satellite telemetry (also with Ampex tapes) and medical\r\nrecords (e.g., electrocardiograms), as part of acquiring a broader base of\r\ninformation for historical recordkeeping and research purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThreats to the loss of information in legacy analog and\r\ndigital recordings include the degradation of the physical media and the large\r\nphysical space required to store the records.  Cataloging and scanning the\r\nanalog data are a way to triage and preserve the data, but this is only the\r\nfirst step of a path toward a scientifically useful product. Grant applications\r\nare sought in the following areas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nDigitization of Legacy Seismo-acoustic Waveform Data\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to improve the\r\nrobustness and automation of techniques to rapidly and accurately digitize\r\nanalog records of legacy seismo-acoustic waveform data.  Scanning records has\r\nlimitations in the tradeoff between scanning time vs. resolution.  A variety of\r\noriginal recording technologies (e.g., paper helicorders, film develocorders),\r\neach with associated idiosyncrasies, generated data that must be recovered [1,\r\n2, 3, 4].  Of interest are methods that streamline the scanning and\r\ndigitization process, ideally allowing for treatment of a variety of original\r\ndata types and correcting for complications such as overlapping signals,\r\nrotating drum distortions, and time marks.  The resulting techniques would\r\nenhance legacy data digitization by enabling automated translation of\r\nhistorical data into a useable form.  Digitizations of interest include signal\r\nand noise spectra at frequencies from approximately 0.02 to 20 Hz and timing\r\nprecision that can be quantified.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.     \r\nMethods to Readily Read, Recover, and Organize Legacy Digital Storage\r\nMedia\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to develop\r\nmethods to readily read, recover, and organize data from legacy digital storage\r\nmedia (e.g., DAT, 9-track, etc.) before these media degrade and become\r\nunreadable [1, 2].  Information of interest includes file formats, as well as\r\nsensor and catalog metadata.  Metadata includes operational time period and\r\nsite information, as well as full digital data recovery.  Particular attention\r\nis needed for reading aging media (physically and magnetically weak), including\r\nthe possibility that media may break and degrade beyond usability after a few\r\nread cycles [3, 4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.      \r\nAnalysis Methods to Identify the Instrument Response Function (IRF) for\r\nDe-convolution\r\n\r\nThe recorded trace on a\r\nseismometer is the incident ground motion convolved with the response function\r\nof the sensor and data acquisition system.  It is necessary to remove the\r\nresponse function from the data in order to obtain the true measured time\r\nhistory of ground motion.  Methods of removing the response function exist if\r\nit is known [1, 2].  However, for a signal recorded from a legacy instrument,\r\nthe amplitude and phase response of the instrument may not have been\r\npreserved.  Many of these legacy instruments no longer exist and records of\r\ncalibrations performed during their lifetime may be missing or incomplete.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe challenge is to conduct\r\nresearch to devise methods of analyzing the waveform time series represented in\r\nthe legacy data to estimate the sensor and data acquisition instrument response\r\nfunction (IRF).  The frequency passband required for seismic waveform analysis\r\nis primarily over the operational monitoring band of 0.02 to 20 Hz, but also of\r\ninterest are methods applicable at lower frequencies down to 0.0083 Hz\r\n(120-second periods).  Possible approaches can include, but not limited to,\r\nanalysis of the microseism and other background noise [3], analysis of recorded\r\nevents in the historical archive with known signal characteristics (such as\r\nlarge magnitude earthquakes), and comparison of the legacy IRF to other nearby\r\nseismometers with known response functions that may have been operating during\r\noverlapping time periods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA potential approach is to develop\r\na signal analysis algorithm to identify the amplitude of the first and\r\nsubsequent peaks, and to derive the uncertainty in these values, given an IRF\r\nand a noise spectrum model, or in a self-consistent analysis in which the full\r\ntrace constrains how significant the IRF and noise are in modifying the size of\r\nthe largest peaks and features. An outcome of interest is to generate such a\r\nself-consistent analysis from a legacy recording trace, and deduce limits on\r\nhow much influence the IRF or noise would have on the amplitude of the major\r\npeaks (primarily the first one), to produce the “true amplitude” and its\r\nuncertainty.  There might be analogous applications in medical record analyses\r\n(e.g., elucidating relative size of s- vs. t- waves vs. other elements of\r\nelectrocardiogram traces) [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.     \r\nOther\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specific\r\nsubtopics listed above, grant applications in other areas relevant to this\r\ntopic are invited.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic a:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nGomes e Silva, A.

A significant challenge for\r\nanalytical imaging technologies is the characterization of a single region of\r\ninterest by complementary methods, which requires precise sample positioning,\r\nidentification of features that warrant analysis by different analytical\r\ntechniques, relocation of regions or features with high accuracy (typically\r\nwithin a few micrometers) on different analytical platforms, correlation of\r\nanalytical signals from disparate technologies (e.g., reflected light,\r\nsecondary electrons or ions, x-ray fluorescence, etc.), and visualization\r\n(e.g., 2-D or 3-D surface mapping).  Therefore, of interest to DNN R&D are\r\ninnovative solutions to (i) rapidly scan surfaces using various microscopies,\r\n(ii) efficiently correlate microanalytical images that provide complementary\r\ninformation, (iii) combine images so that they correctly align, and (iv) enable\r\n2-D and 3-D surface mapping that combine disparate analytical data.  Regions of\r\ninterest can require cross-platform spatial resolution of one micrometer or\r\nless.  For example, features of interest can be identified by rapid scanning\r\nusing one or more imaging techniques (e.g. optical, SEM, SIMS, etc.); regions\r\nare relocated on a separation analytical platform for further analysis at short\r\nlength scales; disparate information streams (e.g., chemical, elemental,\r\nisotopic, morphologic) are correlated to align or overlay features at high\r\nspatial resolution; and finally, optical images are then utilized to develop a\r\n2-D or 3-D surface map combining all analytical information.  Research is\r\nneeded to achieve rapid scanning and spatial alignment of surface maps made by\r\neach microscopy to the same x-y-z position.  Materials of interest may be\r\naffixed to sample holding substrates made of various materials (e.g., glass,\r\ncarbon, plastic, silicon, gold, aluminum, or steel).

On the\r\nsupply-side, there is a shift from large synchronous generators to smaller,\r\nlighter units (e.g., gas-fired turbines) and variable energy resources (e.g.,\r\nrenewables) with utility scale energy storage. On the demand-side, there is a\r\ngrowing number of distributed energy resources, as well as a shift from large\r\ninduction motors to rapidly increasing use of electronic converters in\r\nbuildings, industrial equipment, and consumer devices. The monitoring and\r\ncontrol systems used for operations are also transitioning from analog systems\r\nto systems with increasing data streams and more digital control and\r\ncommunications; from systems with a handful of control points at central\r\nstations to ones with potentially millions of control points.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrid modernization will require the adoption of advanced\r\ntechnologies, such as smart meters, automated feeder switches, fiber optic and\r\nwireless networks, energy storage, and other new hardware. It must also\r\nencompass and enable the application of intelligent devices, next-generation\r\ncomponents, cybersecurity protections, advanced grid modeling and applications,\r\ndistributed energy resources, and innovative architectures. Integration of\r\nthese technologies will require a new communication and control layer to manage\r\na changing mix of supply- and demand-side resources, evolving threats, and to provide\r\nnew services.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe transition to a modern grid will create new technical\r\nchallenges for an electric power system that was not designed for today’s\r\nrequirements. Customers have never relied more on electricity, nor been so\r\ninvolved in where and how it is generated, stored, and used. Utilities will\r\ncontinue retrofitting the existing infrastructure with a variety of smart\r\ndigital devices and communication technologies needed to enable the\r\ndistributed, two-way flow of information and energy.

At the same time, our reliance on\r\nelectricity has grown and tolerance for power interruptions have decreased.\r\nThis means that new operators are entering into an increasingly demanding\r\nenvironment – and may not have much time to learn through trial and experience\r\non the job. Additionally, system operators are facing these new challenges as\r\nthe workforce is aging – stressing existing operator training norms. New\r\nmethods or simulators for training system operators are needed to help train\r\nthe changing workforce. Understanding what system operators require to make\r\ninformed decisions and analysis, human factors innovation in visualization and\r\ndecision making can enable more effective training for new operators. Training\r\nmethods that are able to help the operator learn the uniqueness of the system\r\nthey will be operating, as opposed to a generic power systems, are needed to\r\nmeet the growing complexity of the system. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this subtopic\r\nshould consider:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nState of the art of human factors and cognitive science research \r\n\r\n·        \r\nState of the art visualization methods, including tools not\r\ntraditionally used in the power sector\r\n\r\n·        \r\nUser training and ease of user experience\r\n\r\n·        \r\nMulti-sector system training given electricity system\r\ninterdependences with other sectors (such as natural gas). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCollaboration with power system\r\noperators and utility engineers is strongly encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sandra\r\nJenkins, sandra.jenkins@hq.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic a:\r\n\r\n1.

Grid-tied energy storage systems add\r\nvaluable functionality such as renewable firming, frequency regulation, power\r\nquality enhancement, and dynamic stability support. Grid storage will\r\nultimately improve the reliability, flexibility, security, and quality of the\r\nexisting electricity utility grid.

Critical electrical components\r\nused in PCS are semiconductors, magnetics such as transformers and inductors,\r\nand capacitors. With the advances in wide bandgap semiconductor devices such as\r\nSiC and GaN, new topologies for PCSs are emerging due to their high switching\r\nfrequency, high junction temperature, and high breakdown voltage capabilities.\r\nThere is increased interest in the usage of high-frequency link converters by\r\nutilizing dual active bridge technology.

Innovation\r\nResearch in Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Semiconductor Chip\r\nDesign for Edge Computing in Manufacturing \r\n\r\nThe objective of this subtopic is\r\nto maintain US manufacturing leadership by providing small business\r\nopportunities to develop technologies that will be applied in next-generation\r\nmanufacturing [1]. Small businesses that provide applied Artificial\r\nIntelligence (AI) semiconductor technology design and concept development are\r\nafforded the opportunity to work with US semiconductor fabricators to bring AI\r\ntechnology that will rely on 5G broadband wireless communications to\r\napplications in the US manufacturing sector [2]. Many technologies that are\r\npresently applied in manufacturing process control, for example, that rely on\r\nwired communication links, will be superseded by wireless communications, and\r\nadaptive control approaches based on AI and machine learning strategies will be\r\npossible with the digital computing power that will be accessible with 5G\r\nbroadband wireless communications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits feasibility\r\nresearch in new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that\r\nwill enable AI application in edge computing applications such as automatic\r\ncontrol. This subtopic reflects DOE’s support for to enable 5G/Advanced\r\nWireless Technologies as part of its focus on enabling the Industries of the\r\nFuture as well as DOE\\EERE’s support for Advanced Microelectronics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe introduction of 5G broadband\r\nwireless communications will enable manufacturers to access resources available\r\nonly with 5G wireless – such as cloud computing and complex wireless sensor\r\nnetworks. This broadband access, in turn, will facilitate the application of\r\ndigital computing at points of access or presence in manufacturing operations\r\n(edge computing). This includes AI applications in automatic control of\r\ndiscrete and continuous processes. Open and closed loop control in\r\nmanufacturing requires sensing of process or operation variables and the\r\napplication of algorithms by controllers to act on sensor measurements to\r\ncontrol final elements in control loops. AI-based control approaches derive\r\nalgorithms for closed loop control and models for open loop control using a\r\nvariety of machine learning approaches to analyze data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nASIC designs developed for this subtopic\r\nare expected to be 5G compatible and be of direct use in edge computing applied\r\nto US manufacturing, such as applications in automatic control.

Grant\r\napplications responsive to this Phase 1 funding opportunity will specify the\r\nproposed end use in US manufacturing of new ASIC designs, the AI and machine\r\nlearning approaches to be applied by the ASIC, the possible integration of the\r\nASIC into an edge computing system, and discuss the benefits of the possible\r\nnew technology as compared with current manufacturing practice in the US.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Brian\r\nValentine, Brian.Valentine@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Novel\r\nManufacturing Methods for Membranes and Desalination System Components\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop continuous, precise, and smart manufacturing techniques that have\r\nthe potential to lower the cost and facilitate the adoption of high-performance\r\nmembrane materials and design architectures. Together, such changes in design\r\nand materials manufacturing methods could substantially reduce the time to\r\nmarket for new membranes critical for desalination of water. Novel\r\nmanufacturing methods must be explored to ensure new materials for membranes\r\nand desalination systems can be produced with suitable low-cost and\r\nscalability. Therefore, the R&D supported under this subtopic must improve\r\nmaterials, design, and manufacturability of high-performance membranes and\r\ndesalination system components with the goal of reducing costs relative to\r\ncurrent methods. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the\r\nobjectives of the Water Security Grand Challenge, a DOE-led framework to\r\nadvance transformational technology and innovation to meet the global need for\r\nsafe, secure, and affordable water [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must address one of the\r\nfollowing three areas of interest to be considered responsive to this subtopic:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nLow-cost membrane materials and manufacturing methods: R&D is needed\r\nto advance the next generation of membrane materials and manufacturing methods.\r\nResearchers developing new membrane materials must balance material performance\r\n(e.g., separation properties, thermal conductivity, catalytic activity),\r\nagainst robustness (e.g., mechanical, chemical) and manufacturability (e.g.,\r\ncost, scalability). Materials R&D can lead to improvements in surface\r\nchemistry and interfaces that enable development of materials having 1)\r\nhigh-target ion selectivity, 2) high contaminant removal and water\r\npermeability, and 3) greater chemical resistance, antifouling and\r\ncorrosion-resistance compared to state of the art. Innovations in both membrane\r\nmaterials and related manufacturing methods could vastly expand the range of\r\nwater chemistries over which modular membrane systems are cost-competitive and\r\npotentially eliminate the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and\r\npost-treatment. Innovations in high-performance materials and multifunctional\r\nmembranes enabled by new approaches in materials discovery, synthesis, and\r\ncharacterization are sought. Novel methods of manufacturing that lower cost and\r\nimprove chemical and hydrodynamic performance that could substantially lower\r\nthe energy intensity, levelized cost of water (LCOW), water intensity, and\r\nfailure frequency of treatment processes to increase the nation’s ability to\r\ntap nontraditional water sources also are sought. Such materials for membranes\r\nmay become more cost effective if they can leverage recent additive, gradient,\r\nand roll-to-roll manufacturing advances that lower production costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nManufacturing ultra-low cost, high sensitivity sensors and sensor\r\nnetworks for water quality measurements and detection of emerging contaminants:\r\nCurrent water treatment systems are designed to operate at nominally\r\nsteady-state conditions, relying on human intervention to adapt to variations\r\nin water quality and correct failures in process performance. Simple, robust\r\nsensor networks coupled with sophisticated analytics and controls systems could\r\nenhance performance efficiency, process reliability, and treatment process\r\nadaptability while minimizing the need for onsite, manual interventions. These\r\ninnovations could significantly lower the cost of distributed, fit-for-purpose\r\ndesalination systems and their operational expenses, thus reducing the overall\r\ncost of water treatment This area of interest is focused on developing new,\r\ninnovative sensors and overcoming related manufacturability challenges for high\r\nsensitivity sensors and sensor networks for water quality measurements and\r\ndetection of emerging contaminants. These sensor data could be used to optimize\r\ndesalination and other water treatment processes. Data needs for process\r\ncontrol and monitoring could also be addressed through these new sensors and\r\nsensor networks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nNovel methods and technologies for in-situ characterization of membranes\r\nduring roll-to-roll or otherwise continuous manufacturing: Traditional\r\nmanufacturing methods can hinder the adoption of novel materials and new\r\narchitectural designs in desalination system components such as membranes. To\r\nreduce membrane costs, there is a need to develop roll-to-roll (R2R) platforms\r\nand other continuous manufacturing processes that allow careful control of\r\nmembrane microstructure and performance.

Innovation\r\nResearch in Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Semiconductor Chip\r\nDesign for Edge Computing in Manufacturing \r\n\r\nThe objective of this subtopic is\r\nto maintain US manufacturing leadership by providing small business\r\nopportunities to develop technologies that will be applied in next-generation\r\nmanufacturing [1]. Small businesses that provide applied Artificial\r\nIntelligence (AI) semiconductor technology design and concept development are\r\nafforded the opportunity to work with US semiconductor fabricators to bring AI\r\ntechnology that will rely on 5G broadband wireless communications to\r\napplications in the US manufacturing sector [2]. Many technologies that are\r\npresently applied in manufacturing process control, for example, that rely on\r\nwired communication links, will be superseded by wireless communications, and\r\nadaptive control approaches based on AI and machine learning strategies will be\r\npossible with the digital computing power that will be accessible with 5G\r\nbroadband wireless communications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits feasibility\r\nresearch in new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that\r\nwill enable AI application in edge computing applications such as automatic\r\ncontrol. This subtopic reflects DOE’s support for to enable 5G/Advanced\r\nWireless Technologies as part of its focus on enabling the Industries of the\r\nFuture as well as DOE\\EERE’s support for Advanced Microelectronics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe introduction of 5G broadband\r\nwireless communications will enable manufacturers to access resources available\r\nonly with 5G wireless – such as cloud computing and complex wireless sensor\r\nnetworks. This broadband access, in turn, will facilitate the application of\r\ndigital computing at points of access or presence in manufacturing operations\r\n(edge computing). This includes AI applications in automatic control of\r\ndiscrete and continuous processes. Open and closed loop control in\r\nmanufacturing requires sensing of process or operation variables and the\r\napplication of algorithms by controllers to act on sensor measurements to\r\ncontrol final elements in control loops. AI-based control approaches derive\r\nalgorithms for closed loop control and models for open loop control using a\r\nvariety of machine learning approaches to analyze data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nASIC designs developed for this subtopic\r\nare expected to be 5G compatible and be of direct use in edge computing applied\r\nto US manufacturing, such as applications in automatic control. Small\r\nbusinesses providing promising new ASIC designs would be expected to work with\r\nsemiconductor circuit manufactures to fabricate the new ASIC and integrate\r\nthese into edge computing systems that would be used by manufacturers, with a\r\nspecified purpose such as automatic control of processes and operations. Grant\r\napplications responsive to this Phase 1 funding opportunity will specify the\r\nproposed end use in US manufacturing of new ASIC designs, the AI and machine\r\nlearning approaches to be applied by the ASIC, the possible integration of the\r\nASIC into an edge computing system, and discuss the benefits of the possible\r\nnew technology as compared with current manufacturing practice in the US.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Brian\r\nValentine, Brian.Valentine@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

"subtopic_description": "b.      Novel\r\nManufacturing Methods for Membranes and Desalination System Components\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop continuous, precise, and smart manufacturing techniques that have\r\nthe potential to lower the cost and facilitate the adoption of high-performance\r\nmembrane materials and design architectures. Together, such changes in design\r\nand materials manufacturing methods could substantially reduce the time to\r\nmarket for new membranes critical for desalination of water. Novel\r\nmanufacturing methods must be explored to ensure new materials for membranes\r\nand desalination systems can be produced with suitable low-cost and\r\nscalability. Therefore, the R&D supported under this subtopic must improve\r\nmaterials, design, and manufacturability of high-performance membranes and\r\ndesalination system components with the goal of reducing costs relative to\r\ncurrent methods. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the\r\nobjectives of the Water Security Grand Challenge, a DOE-led framework to\r\nadvance transformational technology and innovation to meet the global need for\r\nsafe, secure, and affordable water [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must address one of the\r\nfollowing three areas of interest to be considered responsive to this subtopic:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nLow-cost membrane materials and manufacturing methods: R&D is needed\r\nto advance the next generation of membrane materials and manufacturing methods.\r\nResearchers developing new membrane materials must balance material performance\r\n(e.g., separation properties, thermal conductivity, catalytic activity),\r\nagainst robustness (e.g., mechanical, chemical) and manufacturability (e.g.,\r\ncost, scalability). Materials R&D can lead to improvements in surface\r\nchemistry and interfaces that enable development of materials having 1)\r\nhigh-target ion selectivity, 2) high contaminant removal and water\r\npermeability, and 3) greater chemical resistance, antifouling and\r\ncorrosion-resistance compared to state of the art. Innovations in both membrane\r\nmaterials and related manufacturing methods could vastly expand the range of\r\nwater chemistries over which modular membrane systems are cost-competitive and\r\npotentially eliminate the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and\r\npost-treatment. Innovations in high-performance materials and multifunctional\r\nmembranes enabled by new approaches in materials discovery, synthesis, and\r\ncharacterization are sought. Novel methods of manufacturing that lower cost and\r\nimprove chemical and hydrodynamic performance that could substantially lower\r\nthe energy intensity, levelized cost of water (LCOW), water intensity, and\r\nfailure frequency of treatment processes to increase the nation’s ability to\r\ntap nontraditional water sources also are sought. Such materials for membranes\r\nmay become more cost effective if they can leverage recent additive, gradient,\r\nand roll-to-roll manufacturing advances that lower production costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nManufacturing ultra-low cost, high sensitivity sensors and sensor\r\nnetworks for water quality measurements and detection of emerging contaminants:\r\nCurrent water treatment systems are designed to operate at nominally\r\nsteady-state conditions, relying on human intervention to adapt to variations\r\nin water quality and correct failures in process performance. Simple, robust\r\nsensor networks coupled with sophisticated analytics and controls systems could\r\nenhance performance efficiency, process reliability, and treatment process\r\nadaptability while minimizing the need for onsite, manual interventions. These\r\ninnovations could significantly lower the cost of distributed, fit-for-purpose\r\ndesalination systems and their operational expenses, thus reducing the overall\r\ncost of water treatment This area of interest is focused on developing new,\r\ninnovative sensors and overcoming related manufacturability challenges for high\r\nsensitivity sensors and sensor networks for water quality measurements and\r\ndetection of emerging contaminants. These sensor data could be used to optimize\r\ndesalination and other water treatment processes. Data needs for process\r\ncontrol and monitoring could also be addressed through these new sensors and\r\nsensor networks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nNovel methods and technologies for in-situ characterization of membranes\r\nduring roll-to-roll or otherwise continuous manufacturing: Traditional\r\nmanufacturing methods can hinder the adoption of novel materials and new\r\narchitectural designs in desalination system components such as membranes. To\r\nreduce membrane costs, there is a need to develop roll-to-roll (R2R) platforms\r\nand other continuous manufacturing processes that allow careful control of\r\nmembrane microstructure and performance. For example, development of new\r\nceramic and composite materials could be accelerated to commercial scale with\r\nresearch on additive and R2R manufacturing, enabled by development of methods\r\nto deposit ceramics on complex shapes and rough surfaces. These advances\r\nrequire the development of 1) in-situ characterization techniques that enable\r\ncontrol of membrane properties during manufacturing; 2) in operando materials\r\ncharacterization techniques that facilitate understanding of membrane\r\nperformance under varying conditions; and 3) manufacturing innovations that enable\r\nthe scalable deployment of novel membrane materials in cost-competitive\r\nmodules. Process optimization could be achieved by advanced characterization\r\ncapabilities, such as in-situ X-ray scattering during R2R processing.\r\nCutting-edge characterization tools at national user facilities could be\r\nleveraged for materials and processes design and optimization of membrane\r\nmanufacturing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Melissa\r\nKlembara, Melissa.Klembara@ee.doe.gov\r\n",

Increasing representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and\r\nengineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research project should\r\ninvestigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbusiness’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that\r\ncould be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall\r\noutcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this\r\nresearch that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.\r\nIdeally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and\r\ntechnologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality\r\nwithin the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,\r\ndemonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with\r\nparallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving\r\nworkplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their\r\nproject with these improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest under\r\nthis subtopic include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of software to foster experiential learning mediated\r\nby employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy\r\ncurriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address\r\nbarriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nResearch to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,\r\nand retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence or other data-driven\r\nplatforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive\r\noperational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if\r\naddressed, can improve business success and expansion. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a robust\r\nevaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce\r\ndevelopment program proposed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications that propose the\r\nfollowing will not be considered for award under this subtopic:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConventional internship and training programs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of this topic includes\r\ncompletion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or\r\ntool.

"subtopic_description": "b.      Cultivating\r\na More Competitive Bioeconomy Through Strengthening Small Business Workforces\r\n\r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals that pilot a research-driven workforce development\r\nprogram or tool that can be widely applicable for the bioeconomy, establishing\r\na partnership with business experts in bioenergy and/or inclusive workforce\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBecause biomass exists across\r\ngeographically diverse regions (i.e., agricultural crops, forestry residues,\r\nMunicipal Solid Waste, algae), people living in urban, suburban, and rural\r\nareas across the country could all benefit from careers and opportunities in\r\nthe bioenergy industry. Increasing representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and\r\nengineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research project should\r\ninvestigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbusiness’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that\r\ncould be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall\r\noutcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this\r\nresearch that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.\r\nIdeally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and\r\ntechnologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality\r\nwithin the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,\r\ndemonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with\r\nparallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving\r\nworkplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their\r\nproject with these improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest under\r\nthis subtopic include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of software to foster experiential learning mediated\r\nby employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy\r\ncurriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address\r\nbarriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nResearch to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,\r\nand retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence or other data-driven\r\nplatforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive\r\noperational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if\r\naddressed, can improve business success and expansion. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a robust\r\nevaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce\r\ndevelopment program proposed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications that propose the\r\nfollowing will not be considered for award under this subtopic:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConventional internship and training programs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of this topic includes\r\ncompletion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or\r\ntool. Phase II includes the deployment of this technology at the bioeconomy\r\nbusiness and scaling the tool to other businesses.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Devinn\r\nLambert, Devinn.Lambert@ee.doe.gov.\r\n",

Remote sensing data, including visual\r\nimagery and other sensor data types (such as infrared or other spectrums) can\r\nbe processed and leveraged for the pre-population of building characteristics\r\nfor use in existing building evaluation platforms. For more information on this\r\ntopic, applicants should refer to BTO’s building data science research,\r\nresources, and tools website [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApproaches should leverage\r\nstandardized data systems, such as Audit Template, BuildingSync, HPXML, ASHRAE\r\n223P, and other relevant management tools to synthesize and aggregate remote\r\nsensing data for automated import into building energy evaluation tools.\r\nProposals should build upon existing tools to meet the requirements for a\r\nremote audit or virtual building inspection and support further identification\r\nof energy efficiency measure opportunities on a site by site basis with similar\r\nresults to traditional auditing techniques.

Building\r\nEnergy Modeling\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits R&D\r\nproposals for new methods, tools, applications for whole building energy\r\nmodeling (BEM) and closely related areas. BTO’s goal is to expand the effective\r\nuse of BEM in all use cases, supporting energy efficiency, demand flexibility,\r\nor both.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhole building energy modeling\r\n(BEM) is a multi-purpose tool for building energy efficiency. At the individual\r\nbuilding project level, it supports optimized design of new and retrofitted\r\nbuildings and districts, HVAC equipment selection, sizing, and control design,\r\ncode-compliance, ratings and certificates, and incentives. BEM on prototypical\r\nmodel supports the development of energy-efficiency codes, design guides,\r\nincentive programs, and products. BEM also has some applications in building\r\noperations. Although BEM typically implies physics-based modeling,\r\nreduced-order, data-driven, and hybrid models have been demonstrated to be\r\nsufficient for some applications and have both model development and execution\r\ntime advantages over physics-based models.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals may target any BEM use\r\ncase (e.g., design, code-compliance, portfolio analysis), any sub-task\r\nassociated with one or more BEM use-cases (e.g., Building Information\r\nModel-to-BEM, model input calibration, quality assurance), any building or\r\nproject type (e.g., new or existing, commercial or residential, individual\r\nbuilding or campus), and any approach (e.g., physics-based, data-driven,\r\nhybrid). Although DOE funds the development of a number open-source\r\nphysics-based BEM tools and packages, use of DOE-funded BEM tools is not\r\nrequired.  Applicants should explicitly state which existing tools (in whole or\r\nin part) they will be using and which (if any) they plan to develop as part of\r\nthe proposed work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterested applicants may refer to\r\nBTO’s draft research & development opportunities document for more\r\ninformation about specific barriers to the effective adoption of BEM and\r\npossible initiatives to address them [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Amir Roth, Amir.Roth@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Solid-State\r\nLighting Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits R&D\r\nproposals for innovative solutions in advanced solid-state lighting\r\ntechnologies (SSL). There are three subtopic areas of interest for Lighting\r\nR&D. Please note that awards may not be made in all areas, and the\r\ndistribution will depend on the number and quality of proposals received. In\r\nall cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the\r\nproposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology\r\ncapabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.\r\nFor more information on these topics, applicants should refer to the Lighting\r\nResearch and Development Opportunities document [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.      SSL\r\nTechnology development – DOE seeks product- and market-facing technology\r\ndevelopment that achieves energy savings in addition to the 2019 baseline or\r\nadvanced functionality based on the features of SSL technology. Gains in energy\r\nsavings and new functionality can be achieved through optical delivery,\r\nintensity controls, source and fixture efficiency, and spectral optimization.\r\nExamples of product or technology advancement include energy savings in SSL applications\r\ninclude, but are not limited to, general illumination, increased productivity,\r\nenhanced well-being, safety improvements, and reduced environmental\r\nimpacts. \r\n\r\n2.      Manufacturing\r\nTechnologies and Materials for SSL –DOE seeks additive and sustainable manufacturing\r\ntechniques and materials for SSL for all portions of the value chain. These\r\ntechniques should enable manufacturing at scale for a wide variety of product\r\nconfigurations with reduced component count, inventory, and production time\r\nwith potential for reduced cost. Also relevant are advancements in product\r\ndesigns and materials that advance the capabilities of additive and/or\r\nsustainable manufacturing without degrading performance or lifetime of\r\nluminaries. Materials should reduce the embodied energy of the luminaire and\r\nshould be readily recycled, reused, or repurposed. This subtopic supports\r\nDOE’s crosscutting emphasis to enable advancements in Advanced Manufacturing as\r\npart of the Administration’s emphasis strengthening U.S. leadership in the\r\nIndustries of the Future; however, SBIR applicants for lighting-specific\r\nmanufacturing should apply to this topic.\r\n\r\n3.      SSL\r\nMaterial Science – DOE seeks research to advance understanding of SSL\r\ndegradation mechanisms, carrier dynamics, performance under different operating\r\nregimes, photon generation and control, and downconverter properties. Research\r\nshould advance the understanding of material-performance relationships for SSL\r\ntechnologies to enable energy saving and performance enhancement, in a way that\r\nimproves the technology’s commercial applications.

In all cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the proposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology capabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, all proposals to this topic must:\r\n\r\n·         Propose a tightly structured program which includes advanced building construction-relevant technical milestones that demonstrate clear progress, are aggressive but achievable, and are quantitative.\r\n\r\n·         Provide evidence that the proposer has relevant advanced building construction experience and capability.\r\n\r\n·         Include projections for cost and/or performance improvements that are tied to a clearly defined baseline and/or state of the art products or practices.\r\n\r\n·         Explicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation with respect to existing commercially available products or solutions.\r\n\r\n·         Include an energy savings impact as well as a preliminary cost analysis.\r\n\r\n·         Report all relevant performance metrics.\r\n\r\n·         Justify all performance claims with theoretical predictions and/or relevant experimental data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must be responsive to the following subtopics. Applications outside of these subtopic areas will not be considered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Diagnostic Technologies and Tools\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for innovative technologies and tools critical for design and manufacturing of retrofit solutions for buildings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnologies that can characterize the key energy and moisture performance-related properties of existing opaque envelopes could facilitate retrofit adoption and aid offsite manufacturing by quantifying the benefit of retrofits, pinpointing specific areas to retrofit, determining if an envelope retrofit can be safely conducted, and verifying post-retrofit performance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNovel nondestructive testing and sensing technologies; simplified, lower-cost physical testing platforms; and novel, low-computational expense data acquisition and synthesis software have the potential to significantly expand the impact and reach of envelope diagnostic technologies. For more information, applicants should review BTO’s DRAFT Research and Development Opportunities Report for Opaque Building Envelopes [1] and ASHRAE’s Review of Non-Destructive Techniques for Building Diagnostic Inspections [2]. Proposals must include supporting data acquisition and processing software that delivers actionable insights to testing personnel. All solutions should minimize setup and teardown effort and time, as well as avoid disruption to building operations or occupants during testing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecifically, DOE seeks proposals in areas that include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel air leakage diagnostic metrology that delivers accurate and fast results regardless of outdoor weather conditions and provides location and quantified extent of infiltration/exfiltration. Technologies that reduce the complexity and effort required to test medium and large commercial buildings are also of interest.\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel diagnostic metrology for envelope moisture performance without needing to remove exterior cladding. Detection of pre-existing moisture and water intrusion issues within envelopes (e.g., exterior wall assemblies) is an important step when considering envelope retrofits, such as those envisioned by BTO’s ABC Initiative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sven Mumme, sven.mumme@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Low-cost, High-R Insulation\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for development of low-cost, high-R factor insulation (targeting under $0.05/inch*R and no greater than $1/square foot per inch) using readily available and scalable manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed solutions should be compatible with existing tooling at the construction site or incorporate a substantial change in installation method that yields lower overall cost, labor effort, and installation time.\r\n\r\nHigh R-value per inch insulation materials that could reduce the cost and complexity of envelope retrofits could make façade retrofits of existing buildings much more feasible and accessible. For more information, applicants should read BTO’s DRAFT: Research and Development Opportunities Report for Opaque Building Envelopes report [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals for sustainable insulation material innovations must meet the cost target and have an R-value/inch of 8 or greater are of interest. Potential areas of for research and development include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n·         Development of durable aerogel insulation using continuous, high-throughput production methods (e.g., in bead form, 3D printing, etc.) at atmospheric processing conditions and in practical building insulation form factors. Aerogels often are very brittle, use very expensive material feedstocks, and utilize complex and expensive manufacturing processes. DOE seeks innovations that result in significant cost reductions of 3-5 times compared to current aerogel costs.\r\n\r\n·         Development of durable, ultralow-cost vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) using high-throughput production methods. VIPs are often regarded as one of the most promising state-of-the-art building insulation solutions given their potential to achieve ultra-low thermal conductivities. While commercially available, VIPs are very expensive, relegating them to niche applications. To make VIPs truly affordable for the building sector, costs need to be cut by a factor of >3-5 times current VIP cost. Dialing back the thermal performance (e.g., to whole panel thermal resistance of R10-15/inch), for instance, could offer extra degrees of freedom on the material, barrier film, vacuum creation, and processing side to enable new cost curves and deliver truly low-cost VIPs.\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel form insulation (spray foam and rigid foam board) that offer improved insulation values at comparable costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sven Mumme, sven.mumme@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Advanced Building Equipment Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for the design of new energy efficient advanced building equipment technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe ABC Initiative focuses on several key areas for building equipment technologies. HVAC and water heating technologies influence the design of new buildings and retrofit opportunities, and by taking these technologies into consideration will allow DOE to expand the ABC R&D portfolio beyond existing state-of-the art integrated heat pump (IHP) solutions. DOE is particularly interested in proposals that leverage previous building equipment R&D to make solutions that are relevant to ABC. For example, IHP technology and multi-functional space-conditioning unit with water heating function can facilitate whole-building, deep energy retrofits in the residential sector by integrating the solution into the building itself, like variable refrigerant flow systems. These technologies lead to significant energy savings (greater than 50%) by recovering condensing waste heat in the cooling season and providing dedicated or desuperheating heat pump water heating. This type of heat exchanger utilizes the high temperature of the superheated refrigerant gas to heat water. For more information, applicants should read BTO’s Energy Savings Potential and RD&D Opportunities for Non-Vapor-Compression HVAC Technologies report [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals in the following specific areas:\r\n\r\n·         Energy and work recovery technologies that significantly advance the state-of-the-art for HVAC and water heating equipment. DOE is particularly interested in technologies that do not rely on passive and expensive materials but could use active (non-vapor compression) technology to transfer waste heat for preheating use. Applicants must demonstrate how the technologies could be incorporated into equipment design.\r\n\r\n·         New approaches, technologies, and concepts that address air and water distribution systems with improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGiven the wide range of ABC building equipment technologies suitable for this subtopic, specific cost targets are not defined in the subtopic; however, applications must outline expected costs of the proposed design, providing analysis to support claims made. Applicants should also consider system approaches at the whole building level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must demonstrate greater than or equal to 30 percent energy efficiency as compared to state-of-the-art or Energy Star equipment, little to no increase in physical size, or little to no increase in difficulty to clean to maintain as-new performance as compared to state-of-the-art or Energy Star equipment, as well as a payback period less than or equal to 5 years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of product or technology advancement include energy savings in HVAC and water applications, including but not limited to general discrete HVAC and water heating equipment, increased productivity, enhanced comfort, and reduced environmental impacts. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Fredericka Brown, Fredericka.brown@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Advanced Building Construction Digitization Solutions\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals that identify and encourage development of innovative information technology solutions that support the objectives of the ABC Initiative and construction digitization, including but not limited to, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAccording to a 2017 report by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the construction industry and its associated manufacturing sector sorely underinvest in the technology and digital tools that would enable significant productivity gains [1]. MGI analysis suggests that lower digitization in the construction industry has contributed to productivity decline, which leads to cost/price escalation, which in turn is a well-documented deterrent to energy efficiency measure adoption. BTO believes that increased digitization and improved construction productivity will lower barriers to energy efficiency and building performance improvements, increase building affordability, and improve building reliability.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComplex software and faster computing power, combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning, allow for the rapid intake and processing of information. For energy-efficient construction, machines can intake visual images, energy analysis and modeling, and other inputs to directly translate data into the fabrication of building components including walls, roofs, or interior design features. This process, also known colloquially as \"art-to-part,\" can help bridge the gap between a traditional building and a high-performance building with smarter, energy-efficient components.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch areas being considered under this topic include but are not limited to “Building Information Modeling (BIM) to fabrication” applications, construction process digitization for process improvement (4D/5D CAD applications), automated QA/QC applications, and automated Building Commissioning solutions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreference will be given to technology solutions that are applicable to both new and existing buildings. While modest feasibility studies are appropriate for Phase I funding, applications for this subtopic should be transitioning to manufacturing by Phase II to be considered for further funding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Eric Werling, eric.werling@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

The\r\nmission of HFTO is to conduct research, development and innovation to enable\r\nthe adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across multiple\r\napplications and sectors at scale. To achieve this goal, HFTO invests in\r\ninnovative technologies that show promise in harnessing American energy\r\nresources safely and efficiently. Fuel cells can address our critical energy\r\nchallenges in all sectors – commercial, residential, industrial, and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fuel can be produced from diverse domestic\r\nresources, such as natural gas, coal, and biomass, as well as from renewables\r\nusing methods such as direct or indirect water splitting.    Hydrogen fuel\r\ncells are an attractive technology to power zero-emissions medium- and\r\nheavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, as well as marine, rail, mining,\r\nand aviation applications. They offer several advantages over incumbent\r\ntechnologies: higher efficiency, reduced emissions, higher torque, and no noise\r\npollution. Additionally, they offer fast fueling and adequate fuel storage for\r\napplications demanding longer range.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe HFTO program funds research and development to address\r\nkey technical challenges for both fuel cells and hydrogen fuels (production,\r\ndelivery, and storage) with medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications as an\r\nemerging area of focus.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications submitted to any of these subtopics must: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nPropose a tightly structured program including technical\r\nmilestones that demonstrate clear progress, are aggressive but achievable, and\r\nare quantitative; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude projections for cost and/or performance improvements that\r\nare tied to a baseline; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nExplicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation\r\nwith respect to existing commercially available products or solutions; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude a preliminary cost analysis and justify all performance\r\nclaims with theoretical predictions and/or relevant experimental data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are sought only in the following subtopics: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Novel\r\nPEM Fuel Cell Membrane Electrode Assemblies for High Efficiency and Durability\r\nin Heavy Duty Applications \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for novel and innovative concepts that advance the\r\ndevelopment and integration of electrocatalysts, membranes, ionomers, and/or\r\ngas diffusion layers for use in heavy-duty direct hydrogen polymer electrolyte\r\nmembrane (PEM) fuel cells, with a focus on high durability and high fuel\r\nefficiency. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMedium- and heavy-duty PEM fuel\r\ncell electric vehicles operating on hydrogen offer several advantages over\r\nincumbent technologies, including higher efficiency, reduced emissions, higher\r\ntorque, and no noise pollution.  Medium- and heavy-duty truck applications\r\nrequire a lifetime of up to one million miles, and therefore require fuel cells\r\nwith innovative membrane, catalyst, and electrode structures with enhanced\r\ndurability. Significantly longer vehicle lifetimes and range requirements also\r\nmean that hydrogen fuel costs comprise a greater proportion of vehicle\r\nlifecycle cost. As such, increased fuel cell efficiency is a key parameter for\r\neconomic viability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe heart of the PEM fuel cell is\r\nthe membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs rely on expensive Platinum Group\r\nMetals (PGM) as catalysts within the electrodes. A critical path to reducing\r\nfuel cell cost, in support of DOE’s Critical Minerals Initiative, is to reduce\r\nthe amount of PGMs used in fuel cells, while maintaining fuel cell durability\r\nand efficiency.  For state-of-the-art MEAs, durability and power output\r\ndecreases with lower PGM loading. This makes it difficult to meet 2030 DOE\r\ntarget of 25,000 hours durability for medium- and heavy-duty transportation\r\napplications while simultaneously meeting targets for system cost ($80/kW) and\r\nefficiency (68% peak) [1]. In the most demanding applications, the conditions\r\ninclude operation in the presence of fuel and air impurities, starting and\r\nstopping, freezing and thawing, and humidity and load cycling that result in\r\nmechanical and chemical stresses on fuel cell materials, components, and\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo expedite heavy-duty fuel cell\r\ncompetitiveness, the DOE launched the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium\r\n(M2FCT), which includes national labs in partnership with universities and\r\nindustry to accelerate R&D that would enable meeting a fuel cell durability\r\nof a million miles. M2FCT is a large-scale, comprehensive effort to enable widespread\r\ncommercialization of fuel cells for heavy duty applications. The M2FCT\r\ncross-disciplinary fuel cell R&D Consortium is focused on achieving\r\naggressive targets for fuel cell MEAs that meet efficiency, durability, and\r\ncost [2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesigns for fuel cell MEAs submitted\r\nin response to this subtopic should demonstrate significant progress toward\r\nmeeting the M2FCT  2025 MEA target of 2.5 kW/gPGM power output (1.07 A/cm2\r\ncurrent density at 0.7 V, <0.3 mg/cm2 PGM loading) after running a\r\nheavy-duty accelerated stress test equivalent to 25,000 hours.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, applications must\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of any novel low-PGM cathode oxygen reduction catalyst\r\nsynthesis, novel membrane synthesis, improved gas diffusion and ionomer\r\nmaterials, and electrode layer design and integration;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach improves durability and efficiency of\r\nlow-cost fuel cells under realistic conditions; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach decreases degradation in new and\r\nstate-of-the-art material sets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should provide\r\nsubstantial evidence that the proposed MEA design and materials represent a\r\nsignificant improvement in efficiency and/or durability over state-of-the-art\r\nPEMFC MEAs that are used in current fuel cell vehicle applications. Applicants\r\nshould collaborate with M2FCT where possible, including testing and utilizing\r\nappropriate accelerated stress tests (ASTs). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Donna Ho, Donna.Ho@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Innovative\r\nApproaches to Minimize Boil-off Losses from Liquid Hydrogen Storage Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor novel concepts, ranging from component level to system scale, that\r\nsubstantially mitigate, recapture, or beneficially use boil-off from either\r\nbulk stationary storage of liquid hydrogen, transfers of liquid hydrogen, or\r\nliquid hydrogen storage systems onboard transportation vessels, such that boil\r\noff is less than 0.1%. Examples include but are not limited to development of\r\nnovel materials and components that manage heat transfer from liquid equipment,\r\nconcepts to capture and recover boil-off vapor, and innovative integration of\r\nstation components (e.g., cryo-pumps and liquid dewars).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen is transported and stored\r\nin liquid form in applications where demand is significant and stable, but\r\nwhere overall regional hydrogen demand is not large enough to warrant the use\r\nof pipelines. Sectors that use liquid hydrogen include space applications,\r\nindustrial facilities (e.g. metal processing plants), and fueling stations for\r\nhydrogen vehicles and material handling equipment. Given the exceptionally low\r\nboiling point of liquid hydrogen (20 K), boil-off losses throughout the\r\ndelivery pathway, which includes trucking, offloading to a facility, storage\r\nand use of the liquid hydrogen at the facility, can be a substantial cost\r\ncontributor. Mitigation of these boil-off losses will become increasingly\r\nimportant as newer applications for liquid hydrogen emerge, e.g. in heavy-duty\r\ntransportation, marine vessels, and rail vessels where hydrogen may be stored\r\nonboard in liquid form. These applications will require a wide range of onboard\r\nliquid hydrogen storage capacities, from around 60 kg for long-haul Class 8\r\ntrucks, to thousands of kgs for larger marine vessels. Boil-off losses in these\r\nuse cases are intimately tied to dormancy and duty cycles and could be just as\r\nsignificant as those present in refueling stations. Strategies to eliminate the\r\nboil-off of fuels in general have been explored in many other industries to\r\ndate, including the aerospace and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sectors.\r\nApproaches that have been studied include innovative methods of insulation,\r\nmixing of layers within liquid dewars to prevent stratification, use of\r\ncryo-coolers, recovery of boil-off to power ancillary equipment, and\r\nsophisticated cryo-pump designs. Many of these approaches are\r\ncapital-intensive, which prohibits their widespread use and would hinder any\r\nability to achieve HFTO’s hydrogen cost targets. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the effort is expected\r\nto involve an in-depth analysis that includes a preliminary design of the\r\nselected component(s) or strategy, as well as specific research, development,\r\nand (if reasonable within the Phase I budget) proof-of-concept testing of any\r\nnew components or processes to show that they have the potential to be\r\nincorporated into a liquid hydrogen storage system. Phase II should focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at a scale relevant to demonstrate the\r\nviability of the concept for the specific application or use case being\r\ntargeted. Identification of commercialization strategies and a market analysis\r\nshould also be included. Identification of potential commercialization\r\npartners, with indication of commitment, would greatly strengthen Phase II\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Zeric Hulvey,\r\nZeric.Hulvey@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       In-line\r\nFilter for Particulate Matter at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic seeks concepts that can remove particulate contaminants from hydrogen\r\nfuel at fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fueling stations for fuel\r\ncell vehicles conventionally use filters to prevent particulate matter from\r\ncontaminating the vehicle [1]. Limits for particulate matter in hydrogen fuel\r\nfor vehicles have been established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\r\nJ2719 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14687\r\nstandards.[2] Per SAE J2719, particulate matter must be limited to 1 mg/kg H2,\r\nand 99% of particulates larger than 5 micrometers should be removed before\r\nreaching a vehicle.[3] Filters that meet SAE J2719 requirements are available\r\nfor light duty vehicle fueling stations, where the peak flow rate is less than\r\n2 kg/min. However, filters that can support the need to fill at the higher flow\r\nrates (60 kg or more in approximately 6-10 minutes), needed for fueling medium-\r\n(MD) and heavy-duty (HD) vehicles, are not commercially available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed filter concepts must be\r\ncapable of continuous operation at -40°C and pressures of 700-1,000 bar. The\r\nunit design should account for any occurring pressure drop due to the\r\nfiltration. The unit developed must be capable of installation within a\r\nhydrogen dispenser, and potentially, at multiple points in the fueling system\r\n(e.g. between compressor stages) to mitigate the consequences of failure. The\r\nunit must be capable of an average flow rate of approximately 10 kg H2/min [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should include\r\nconcept development and feasibility evaluation of filter materials and design\r\nfor key metrics, including durability under 1,000 bar pressure and -40°C\r\ntemperature, and ability to meet SAE J2719 particulate requirements. Further, the\r\nresistance across the filter should not generate sufficient pressure drop to\r\nimpact the desired flow rate and dispensing pressures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase II proposals will involve\r\nincorporation of the filter design into a device that should additionally be\r\neasily field replaceable, and validation of the device. Phase II proposals must\r\nidentify service life and provide criteria for filter replacement. Concepts\r\nproposed should target a capital cost of $500 or less. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Efficient\r\nChillers for Hydrogen Pre-cooling at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor R&D of novel concepts that will allow for maximum hydrogen refueling of\r\nmedium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) vehicles compared with traditional fuel routes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterest in the use of fuel cells\r\nonboard MD/HD vehicles is growing rapidly, due to their potential to enable\r\nhigh-power operation, long range, and zero emissions. Deployment of MD/HD fuel\r\ncell vehicles will require the development of novel hydrogen fueling\r\ntechnologies that can enable fills that are over five times faster than those\r\nof light-duty hydrogen fueling stations. While a fueling protocol for MD/HD\r\nfuel cell vehicles has not yet been established, the DOE’s target for hydrogen\r\nfueling of 700 bar onboard storage tanks include a fill rate of 10 kg/min with\r\na hydrogen gas temperature of -40 °C [1]. Hydrogen chillers that can achieve\r\n-40 °C fills are commercially available, but do not meet the flow rate and\r\ncooling capacity requirements of MD/HD vehicles. Cooling capacities of up to\r\n100 kW will be necessary to facilitate 10 kg/min refueling at -40 °C.[2]   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed concepts must adhere to\r\nthe flow rate and temperature standards of 10 kg/min (maximum) and -33 °C\r\nat the point of dispensing within 30 seconds; however, viable alternatives to\r\ntemperature standards will be considered. Proposed concepts can range in scope\r\nfrom component to system level. Examples include, but are not limited to,\r\nchillers that enable on-demand supply of cold hydrogen, short-term intermediate\r\ncold storage, and systems that circumvent hydrogen precooling. Proposed\r\nconcepts should be applicable for use of either gaseous or liquid on-site bulk\r\nstorage of hydrogen, however on-site hydrogen liquefaction concepts will not be\r\nconsidered for this subtopic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the project is expected\r\nto focus on an in-depth analysis of the system or component(s) proposed,\r\nrefueling protocol efficiency and overall costs. Testing protocols, including\r\nsafety, should also be established as a part of Phase I. Phase II will focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at the laboratory scale.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.

In the most demanding applications, the conditions\r\ninclude operation in the presence of fuel and air impurities, starting and\r\nstopping, freezing and thawing, and humidity and load cycling that result in\r\nmechanical and chemical stresses on fuel cell materials, components, and\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo expedite heavy-duty fuel cell\r\ncompetitiveness, the DOE launched the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium\r\n(M2FCT), which includes national labs in partnership with universities and\r\nindustry to accelerate R&D that would enable meeting a fuel cell durability\r\nof a million miles. M2FCT is a large-scale, comprehensive effort to enable widespread\r\ncommercialization of fuel cells for heavy duty applications. The M2FCT\r\ncross-disciplinary fuel cell R&D Consortium is focused on achieving\r\naggressive targets for fuel cell MEAs that meet efficiency, durability, and\r\ncost [2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesigns for fuel cell MEAs submitted\r\nin response to this subtopic should demonstrate significant progress toward\r\nmeeting the M2FCT  2025 MEA target of 2.5 kW/gPGM power output (1.07 A/cm2\r\ncurrent density at 0.7 V, <0.3 mg/cm2 PGM loading) after running a\r\nheavy-duty accelerated stress test equivalent to 25,000 hours.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, applications must\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of any novel low-PGM cathode oxygen reduction catalyst\r\nsynthesis, novel membrane synthesis, improved gas diffusion and ionomer\r\nmaterials, and electrode layer design and integration;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach improves durability and efficiency of\r\nlow-cost fuel cells under realistic conditions; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach decreases degradation in new and\r\nstate-of-the-art material sets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should provide\r\nsubstantial evidence that the proposed MEA design and materials represent a\r\nsignificant improvement in efficiency and/or durability over state-of-the-art\r\nPEMFC MEAs that are used in current fuel cell vehicle applications.

"subtopic_description": "b.      Innovative\r\nApproaches to Minimize Boil-off Losses from Liquid Hydrogen Storage Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor novel concepts, ranging from component level to system scale, that\r\nsubstantially mitigate, recapture, or beneficially use boil-off from either\r\nbulk stationary storage of liquid hydrogen, transfers of liquid hydrogen, or\r\nliquid hydrogen storage systems onboard transportation vessels, such that boil\r\noff is less than 0.1%. Examples include but are not limited to development of\r\nnovel materials and components that manage heat transfer from liquid equipment,\r\nconcepts to capture and recover boil-off vapor, and innovative integration of\r\nstation components (e.g., cryo-pumps and liquid dewars).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen is transported and stored\r\nin liquid form in applications where demand is significant and stable, but\r\nwhere overall regional hydrogen demand is not large enough to warrant the use\r\nof pipelines. Sectors that use liquid hydrogen include space applications,\r\nindustrial facilities (e.g. metal processing plants), and fueling stations for\r\nhydrogen vehicles and material handling equipment. Given the exceptionally low\r\nboiling point of liquid hydrogen (20 K), boil-off losses throughout the\r\ndelivery pathway, which includes trucking, offloading to a facility, storage\r\nand use of the liquid hydrogen at the facility, can be a substantial cost\r\ncontributor. Mitigation of these boil-off losses will become increasingly\r\nimportant as newer applications for liquid hydrogen emerge, e.g. in heavy-duty\r\ntransportation, marine vessels, and rail vessels where hydrogen may be stored\r\nonboard in liquid form. These applications will require a wide range of onboard\r\nliquid hydrogen storage capacities, from around 60 kg for long-haul Class 8\r\ntrucks, to thousands of kgs for larger marine vessels. Boil-off losses in these\r\nuse cases are intimately tied to dormancy and duty cycles and could be just as\r\nsignificant as those present in refueling stations. Strategies to eliminate the\r\nboil-off of fuels in general have been explored in many other industries to\r\ndate, including the aerospace and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sectors.\r\nApproaches that have been studied include innovative methods of insulation,\r\nmixing of layers within liquid dewars to prevent stratification, use of\r\ncryo-coolers, recovery of boil-off to power ancillary equipment, and\r\nsophisticated cryo-pump designs. Many of these approaches are\r\ncapital-intensive, which prohibits their widespread use and would hinder any\r\nability to achieve HFTO’s hydrogen cost targets. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the effort is expected\r\nto involve an in-depth analysis that includes a preliminary design of the\r\nselected component(s) or strategy, as well as specific research, development,\r\nand (if reasonable within the Phase I budget) proof-of-concept testing of any\r\nnew components or processes to show that they have the potential to be\r\nincorporated into a liquid hydrogen storage system. Phase II should focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at a scale relevant to demonstrate the\r\nviability of the concept for the specific application or use case being\r\ntargeted. Identification of commercialization strategies and a market analysis\r\nshould also be included. Identification of potential commercialization\r\npartners, with indication of commitment, would greatly strengthen Phase II\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Zeric Hulvey,\r\nZeric.Hulvey@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

"subtopic_description": "c.       In-line\r\nFilter for Particulate Matter at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic seeks concepts that can remove particulate contaminants from hydrogen\r\nfuel at fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fueling stations for fuel\r\ncell vehicles conventionally use filters to prevent particulate matter from\r\ncontaminating the vehicle [1]. Limits for particulate matter in hydrogen fuel\r\nfor vehicles have been established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\r\nJ2719 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14687\r\nstandards.[2] Per SAE J2719, particulate matter must be limited to 1 mg/kg H2,\r\nand 99% of particulates larger than 5 micrometers should be removed before\r\nreaching a vehicle.[3] Filters that meet SAE J2719 requirements are available\r\nfor light duty vehicle fueling stations, where the peak flow rate is less than\r\n2 kg/min. However, filters that can support the need to fill at the higher flow\r\nrates (60 kg or more in approximately 6-10 minutes), needed for fueling medium-\r\n(MD) and heavy-duty (HD) vehicles, are not commercially available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed filter concepts must be\r\ncapable of continuous operation at -40°C and pressures of 700-1,000 bar. The\r\nunit design should account for any occurring pressure drop due to the\r\nfiltration. The unit developed must be capable of installation within a\r\nhydrogen dispenser, and potentially, at multiple points in the fueling system\r\n(e.g. between compressor stages) to mitigate the consequences of failure. The\r\nunit must be capable of an average flow rate of approximately 10 kg H2/min [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should include\r\nconcept development and feasibility evaluation of filter materials and design\r\nfor key metrics, including durability under 1,000 bar pressure and -40°C\r\ntemperature, and ability to meet SAE J2719 particulate requirements. Further, the\r\nresistance across the filter should not generate sufficient pressure drop to\r\nimpact the desired flow rate and dispensing pressures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase II proposals will involve\r\nincorporation of the filter design into a device that should additionally be\r\neasily field replaceable, and validation of the device. Phase II proposals must\r\nidentify service life and provide criteria for filter replacement. Concepts\r\nproposed should target a capital cost of $500 or less. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

Efficient\r\nChillers for Hydrogen Pre-cooling at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor R&D of novel concepts that will allow for maximum hydrogen refueling of\r\nmedium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) vehicles compared with traditional fuel routes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterest in the use of fuel cells\r\nonboard MD/HD vehicles is growing rapidly, due to their potential to enable\r\nhigh-power operation, long range, and zero emissions. Deployment of MD/HD fuel\r\ncell vehicles will require the development of novel hydrogen fueling\r\ntechnologies that can enable fills that are over five times faster than those\r\nof light-duty hydrogen fueling stations. While a fueling protocol for MD/HD\r\nfuel cell vehicles has not yet been established, the DOE’s target for hydrogen\r\nfueling of 700 bar onboard storage tanks include a fill rate of 10 kg/min with\r\na hydrogen gas temperature of -40 °C [1]. Hydrogen chillers that can achieve\r\n-40 °C fills are commercially available, but do not meet the flow rate and\r\ncooling capacity requirements of MD/HD vehicles. Cooling capacities of up to\r\n100 kW will be necessary to facilitate 10 kg/min refueling at -40 °C.[2]   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed concepts must adhere to\r\nthe flow rate and temperature standards of 10 kg/min (maximum) and -33 °C\r\nat the point of dispensing within 30 seconds; however, viable alternatives to\r\ntemperature standards will be considered. Proposed concepts can range in scope\r\nfrom component to system level. Examples include, but are not limited to,\r\nchillers that enable on-demand supply of cold hydrogen, short-term intermediate\r\ncold storage, and systems that circumvent hydrogen precooling. Proposed\r\nconcepts should be applicable for use of either gaseous or liquid on-site bulk\r\nstorage of hydrogen, however on-site hydrogen liquefaction concepts will not be\r\nconsidered for this subtopic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the project is expected\r\nto focus on an in-depth analysis of the system or component(s) proposed,\r\nrefueling protocol efficiency and overall costs.

Applications on technologies related to PV electrical connections will be considered nonresponsive if submitted to this topic (Topic 16, Solar Energy Technologies).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are sought in the following subtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Method for Mechanical Load Testing of Photovoltaic Modules with Concurrently Applied Stressors and Diagnostic Methods\r\n\r\nThis is a Technology Transfer Opportunity for a non-exclusive license to commercialize a newly developed and PV module testing platform that allows for simultaneous application of multiple stress factors of the natural environment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComprehensive design testing of PV modules is challenging. Typically, stresses at levels higher than those occurring in the natural environment are applied to achieve acceleration. These stress factors are usually applied in steady state, with fewer stress factors, or in combinations and sequences that do not reflect real world conditions. Also, stress tests are frequently designed around failure modes in existing designs that have already manifested in the field, limiting our ability to predict the potential occurrence of failures with new PV module materials and designs. Real-world load tests – required for modules in environments in which high wind or snow loading is commonplace – are difficult to replicate because currently used techniques cannot replicate the high frequency module vibration experienced in high winds while also thermally stressing the module, allowing for water ingress, and allowing exposure to light. Current methods for applying mechanical load to a module for mechanical testing obstruct significant amount of light from at least one side of the module whereas open rack systems, especially for bifacial modules, are designed for exposure to light from both faces of the module. While each of the stress factors are frequently applied in isolation, no current test for full size commercial PV modules can replicate the combination of stress factors as occurs in the natural environment in which they have been known unexpectedly fail, in part because of the limitation of commonly used stress tests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a PV module testing platform to simultaneously apply multiple stress factors of the natural environment (light, heat, moisture, system voltage, and mechanical stress) to achieve a comprehensive test of module durability. The simulation applies levels corresponding to the extremes of the conditions found in the natural environment using a four-cell mini module platform. We seek the scale up and commercialization of a system for full size modules with these five stress factors, including a system that applies an oscillating mechanical load to the edges of a PV module in such a way so as to avoid obstructing the active cell area. To achieve this, the module can be vibrated at its mounting points so that the interior of the module is rapidly displaced by its own momentum. Avoiding the obstruction of light this way, additional stressors including light, heat, moisture would be simultaneously applied the active area of the module such that they me be monitored by optical or electro-optical means to evaluate any module degradation in-situ. NREL is currently looking for partners to help with prototyping and commercialization of the combined- accelerated stress testing system for the evaluation of durability of full-size commercial PV modules.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: National Renewable Energy Laboratory\r\n\r\nContact: Bill Hadley; bill.hadley@nrel.gov; (303) 275 3015\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive\r\n\r\nPatent Status: Pending\r\n\r\nNREL tracking number: 19-64\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Nanocomposite Barrier Films for Photovoltaic Applications\r\n\r\nThis Technology Transfer Opportunity solicits interested companies to license a newly developed and patented thin film coating that can be used as an encapsulant for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coating in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPolymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN) thin film coatings have improved water vapor and oxygen permeability, in addition to improved corrosion resistance, while retaining high transparency, high electrical resistivity, and excellent fire-retardant properties for use as encapsulants for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coatings in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn these unique composite materials, repeated sequential deposition of solutions of clays (vermiculite, montmorillonite, etc.) and solutions of polymers (polyethylenimine,  poly(acrylic acid, etc.) layer with complimentary charged functional groups (positive and negative) forms a coating.  The coating can be deposited with many various repeating schemes as it is built one layer at a time. Once cured, the microstructure resembles a brick and mortar system where the clay platelets are the “bricks” and the polymer is the ”mortar”. The facile and scalable layer-by-layer processing is applicable to many substrates, from porous and flexible items such as fabrics and foams to hard dense materials such as glass or ceramics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs an impermeable barrier, the structure dictates a tortuous path for oxygen or water molecules to follow, which decreases the water transmission rate by over an order of magnitude beyond ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). During a fire, the applied composite coating reduces the heat rate release, and can act as a flame retardant system. In an arcing electrical system, the PCN coating promotes extinguishment and increases time to flame by as much as 300%.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSandia National Laboratories Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: Sandia National Laboratories\r\n\r\nContact: Margaret Gordon, megord@sandia.gov\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive\r\n\r\nPatent Status: Active - https://patents.google.com/patent/US10002983B1/\r\n\r\nPublication date: 06/19/2018\r\n\r\nFiling date: 05/24/2017\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Floating Solar-Powered Aeration Systems\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks innovations that can advance the application of floating solar-powered aeration systems (FSAS) to improve water quality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAeration is the introduction of air into aquatic systems to support the growth of aerobic bacteria and aquatic life. Facilitating the oxidative decomposition of biological materials, aeration can also remove the gaseous products of decomposition, including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Many natural systems depend upon aeration to maintain a diversity of animal and plant species, as well as overall health. However, a surplus of nutrients, restricted mixing and flow, or significant depth can deplete dissolved oxygen in aqueous systems [1, 2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArtificial aeration has been developed to address this issue. As a technology, aeration is generally applied to establish, maintain, or restore sufficient dissolved oxygen to ensure successful remediation and protection of water resources, including natural bodies of water (e.g., rivers, lakes) and artificial ones (e.g., fish farms, lagoons) [2]. Recently, self-powered, autonomous units that combine floating photovoltaics and aeration have been implemented to help restore natural water resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications should fall within one of the following three broad areas for ecosystem management on water systems:\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for environmental restoration and protection of natural water systems [1, 2];\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for sustainable water systems for aquaculture [3];\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for sustainable waste bio-processing water systems [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications for FSAS outside these three categories will be considered if they focus on aeration via a floating solar-powered system. Applications should describe aeration parameters such as depth, timing, and rate of aeration; electrical-system specifics such as power requirements, electrical storage, and control systems; and any other subsystems in sufficient detail to explain the innovation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSETO is particularly interested in applications developing technologies that:\r\n\r\n·         Reduce operating costs by using FSAS to improve water quality;\r\n\r\n·         Reduce the balance-of-system costs of an FSAS;\r\n\r\n·         Improve the effectiveness and operation of FSAS;\r\n\r\n·         Build synergy between FSAS and other unit operations to add value via enhanced system functionality; and\r\n\r\n·         Generate an excess of electricity beyond that needed for aeration to provide power for external electrical systems (either floating, submerged, or shore-based).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Solar Systems Resilient to Weather-related or Cyber Threats\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks innovative proposals to improve the ability of solar assets or electronic devices associated with solar energy generation (such as inverters, direct current (DC)-DC optimizers, and smart meters) and systems to quickly recover in response to weather-related or cyber threats [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of SETO’s priorities is to enhance the ability of solar energy technologies to contribute to grid reliability and resilience, including the security and resilience of the nation’s critical infrastructure. Infrastructure systems, including the electrical grid and solar generation assets, are vulnerable to weather-related threats, cyberattacks, and other disruptive events. Increased asset resilience presents opportunities to maximize operability and energy availability and minimize restoration costs following these occurrences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this subtopic may address specific component or system designs that improve survival; improve recovery time; ensure access control, confidentiality, integrity, availability, or non-repudiation of assets; and minimize cost associated with disruptive events. Component or system designs may achieve these goals passively (e.g., via more robust designs or configurations) or actively (e.g., via “hardened” components, including any component that is connected in a smart power systems injection/absorption role).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a basic cost-model analysis showing the cost/benefit of the proposed solution in comparison to current state of the art. Proposed solutions should discuss the component(s) being addressed, potential threats that will be deterred, method of integration (especially clarifying if it is part of a traditional PV component for integration at install or a retrofit for a fielded device), how interoperability with other components is considered, and how compromises or attempted compromises are conveyed to the relevant parties. Applications should also identify a possible case use by defining the time to recover the system’s full functionalities, and provide substantiated estimates for the capabilities of the proposed approach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of targets and metrics for hardened solar system performance include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Percent of system operable after a disruptive event (applications should specify type and intensity of the threat);\r\n\r\n·         Time to full system operability after extreme event (restoration time);\r\n\r\n·         Reduction in system restoration cost following disruptive event;\r\n\r\n·         Level of functionality without grid support following extreme event (islanding).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they do not demonstrate clear innovation compared to the current state of the art, particularly regarding microgrid and/or islanding behaviors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.      Innovation in Solar Aesthetics for Residential Photovoltaic Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for technologies that improve the aesthetic appeal of photovoltaic systems for use in residential applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile the PV market has continued to expand rapidly, the rooftop residential market has not grown at the same pace as the utility PV market, as a percentage of added capacity [1]. A survey of solar installers reported 40% of them consider aesthetics to be key when recommending which panels to install [2]. An NREL survey of potential adopters found that approximately 30% of people stopped considering PV installations due to concerns about aesthetics or the impact on the home’s resale value [3]. Another survey, of residential customers, found customers do not find currently available solar products attractive, ranking appearance a priority above reliability but below efficiency and price [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the installed cost per watt has remained high, mainly owing to the slower reduction in non-hardware costs for this segment of the market. This could create an opportunity where an aesthetically pleasing solar module, even with a slightly higher hardware cost, could unlock new portions of the residential market that are sensitive to appearances.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Innovations that greatly improve the aesthetic appeal of a PV installation\r\n\r\n·         Innovations that mask the PV installation as some other component of the home or landscaping.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they do not demonstrate clear innovation compared to the current state of the art, particularly in regard to PV module skins and PV-integrated roof shingles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nf.        Commercial and Industrial Solar Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits applications for innovative technologies that can reduce the installed cost of commercial and industrial (C&I) solar systems, improve their energy yield, facilitate their installation and grid interconnection, and enable additional value streams from them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe C&I solar market has historically trailed the utility and residential segments, and while the utility sector was up 89% year over year in the second quarter of 2020, the nonresidential sector was down 14% in the same period. Many barriers exist in C&I solar that drive that discrepancy, but there is an opportunity to develop new technologies that can enhance the value proposition. For example, the enhanced energy yield offered by tracking technology could be a game-changer in the C&I market, with its tight margins and complex transactions. Tracking technology has revolutionized the utility-scale solar sector over the past decade, with 65% of all U.S. utility-scale PV systems using single-axis tracking technology as of the end of 2019 (and 82% of U.S. utility-scale PV systems installed in 2019 using single-axis tracking technology) [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications developing technologies for solar tracking on commercial rooftops or carports are also encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ng.      Agricultural Solar Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can reduce the installed cost of streams from agricultural solar systems, improve the systems’ energy yield, facilitate their installation and grid interconnection, and enable additional value. Of particular interest are new system designs and technologies that optimize solar and agriculture production, which may include novel mounting and racking designs or site configurations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough land requirements for solar energy represent a small percentage of the country (92 GW of solar estimated for 2030, which is estimated to require less than 0.1% of the land in the contiguous United States), the growth in ground-mounted solar can create competition with agricultural land for land use. Co-locating solar PV and agriculture could provide diversified revenue sources and ecological benefits for agricultural enterprises while reducing land-use competition and siting restrictions. Except for growing pollinator habitat at solar facilities, the co-location of solar and agriculture is primarily limited to research sites. There are many opportunities to develop new technologies that enable agricultural production (i.e., crop or livestock production, or pollinator habitat) underneath or around solar energy systems that optimize both energy and agricultural production at co-located sites [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nValue streams of interest under this subtopic include, but are not limited to, increased agricultural yield and quality of life improvements, such as temperature reduction via shading. Applicants must include a strategy for future work to validate additional benefit/value streams, like crop field studies, for example.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nh.      Components for Gen3 CSP Thermal Transport Systems\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Energy Storage Grand Challenge [1], this subtopic seeks proposals for the design of components for the next generation of Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP) generation technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCSP technologies can be used to generate electricity by converting energy from sunlight to power a turbine. SETO is developing next generation CSP technologies (Gen3 CSP) which aim to deliver heat to a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)-based turbine at or above 700 °C. The Gen3 CSP program [2] identified several heat transfer media (HTM) that showed promise in meeting SETO’s electricity cost goals of $0.05/kWh. The program was then organized by the phase of matter for leading HTM— gas, liquid, or solid. Released in 2017, the Gen3 Roadmap study describes the best understanding of potential Gen3 technologies [3]. Since 2017, additional relevant research and analysis has entered the public domain [4-8].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the candidate Gen3 CSP thermal transport systems are based on:\r\n\r\n·         Chloride salt blends. A mixture of magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (MgCl2-NaCl-KCl) is a leading salt-based HTM candidate for Gen3. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include catastrophic corrosion in the presence of oxygen or moisture, low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum thermal flux on the leading nickel alloy receivers, and freeze risk. The Gen3 liquid-phase team has determined that a liquid sodium receiver is ultimately less risky than a chloride salt receiver with technologies presently available, however, this salt remains the leading choice of the Gen3 team to transport energy up and down a tower and to act as the thermal energy storage (TES) medium.\r\n\r\n·         Supercritical fluids. Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) has been considered as a HTM for the Gen3 gas phase system. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include: high-pressure and low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum allowable flux on nickel alloy receivers; high parasitic losses in circulation greatly impacted by pressure drop in the receiver; creep and fatigue failure of the receiver; and, a higher receiver outlet temperature needed for additional temperature drops in indirect thermal energy storage systems (such as particle beds).\r\n\r\n·         Particles. Sand-like particles may avoid many of the issues associated with fluid high temperature systems due to the ability to operate at ambient pressure and with limited corrosion or thermal stability risk. Challenges include: operability limitations; risk of particle degradation with time at temperature; scaling limitations; efficiency of heat exchange in the receiver and primary heater; and general challenges in particle transport and mass flow control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo further develop Gen3 CSP systems and ensure their feasibility in the market, there is a need to design, build and test Gen3 system components that will be economically viable in future Gen3 plants. Applicants are expected to include the design, feasibility, and cost validation of new or improved components and subsystems during their Phase I application; lab scale testing, and prototype manufacturing of such components is of interest in Phase II applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following are specific components that are of interest for development and desired performance parameters that would be supported under this subtopic: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComponents \r\n\r\n·         Receivers:\r\n\r\no   Thermal efficiency > 90%.\r\n\r\no   Cost < 75 $/kWth (receiver only; excludes tower and piping).\r\n\r\no   Total receiver system cost including tower, piping, and cold salt pump < 150 $/kWth.\r\n\r\no   Lifetime > 10,000 cycles.\r\n\r\no   Applicable to gas, particle, or molten salt operation at >750°C.\r\n\r\n·         Hot and cold salt pumps:\r\n\r\no   Designed for 720°C operation.\r\n\r\no   Operating power less than 5% of plant annual output.

Affordability, Reliability, and Performance of Solar Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for solutions that can advance solar energy technologies by lowering cost [1] and facilitate the secure integration into the Nation’s energy grid.

In the past few years, SETO has funded several programs to support multi-stakeholder teams as they research and develop solutions to reduce significant barriers to solar energy adoption through innovative models, technologies, and real-world data sets. The areas of interest, analysis, taxonomies, and best practices developed from these programs can be leveraged as the impetus for small-business innovation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a clear assessment of the state of the art and how the proposed technology would represent a significant improvement, along with a basic cost-model analysis showing a path to becoming cost-competitive with current state of the art and the potential to increase solar generation on the grid.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they are not based on sound scientific principles, are within the scope of any other of the subtopic listed under the Solar Energy Technologies topic, or do any of the following:\r\n\r\n·         Focus exclusively on HVAC or water heating applications;\r\n\r\n·         Propose development of concentrated PV or solar spectrum splitting technologies;\r\n\r\n·         Propose development of technologies with very low possibility of being manufactured domestically at a competitive cost (e.g., PV modules based on copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) or amorphous silicon thin films; technologies assuming incorporation of functional materials, such as quantum dots or luminescent solar concentrators);\r\n\r\n·         Propose technologies to improve the shade tolerance of PV modules;\r\n\r\n·         Business plans or proofs of concept that do not include documentation supporting their necessity or benefit.

"subtopic_description": "a.      TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Method for Mechanical Load Testing of Photovoltaic\r\nModules with Concurrently Applied Stressors and Diagnostic Methods\r\n\r\nThis is a Technology Transfer\r\nOpportunity for a non-exclusive license to commercialize a newly developed and\r\nPV module testing platform that allows for simultaneous application of multiple\r\nstress factors of the natural environment. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComprehensive design testing of PV\r\nmodules is challenging. Typically, stresses at levels higher than those\r\noccurring in the natural environment are applied to achieve acceleration. These\r\nstress factors are usually applied in steady state, with fewer stress factors,\r\nor in combinations and sequences that do not reflect real world conditions. \r\nAlso, stress tests are frequently designed around failure modes in existing\r\ndesigns that have already manifested in the field, limiting our ability to\r\npredict the potential occurrence of failures with new PV module materials and\r\ndesigns. Real-world load tests – required for modules in environments in which\r\nhigh wind or snow loading is commonplace – are difficult to replicate because\r\ncurrently used techniques cannot replicate the high frequency module vibration\r\nexperienced in high winds while also thermally stressing the module, allowing\r\nfor water ingress, and allowing exposure to light. Current methods for applying\r\nmechanical load to a module for mechanical testing obstruct significant amount\r\nof light from at least one side of the module whereas open rack systems,\r\nespecially for bifacial modules, are designed for exposure to light from both\r\nfaces of the module. While each of the stress factors are frequently applied in\r\nisolation, no current test for full size commercial PV modules can replicate\r\nthe combination of stress factors as occurs in the natural environment in which\r\nthey have been known unexpectedly fail, in part because of the limitation of\r\ncommonly used stress tests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Renewable Energy\r\nLaboratory (NREL) has developed a PV module testing platform to simultaneously\r\napply multiple stress factors of the natural environment (light, heat,\r\nmoisture, system voltage, and mechanical stress) to achieve a comprehensive\r\ntest of module durability. The simulation applies levels corresponding to the\r\nextremes of the conditions found in the natural environment using a four-cell\r\nmini module platform. We seek the scale up and commercialization of a system\r\nfor full size modules with these five stress factors, including a system that\r\napplies an oscillating mechanical load to the edges of a PV module in such a way\r\nso as to avoid obstructing the active cell area.  To achieve this, the module\r\ncan be vibrated at its mounting points so that the interior of the module is\r\nrapidly displaced by its own momentum. Avoiding the obstruction of light this\r\nway, additional stressors including light, heat, moisture would be\r\nsimultaneously applied the active area of the module such that they me be\r\nmonitored by optical or electro-optical means to evaluate any module\r\ndegradation in-situ. NREL is currently looking for partners to help with\r\nprototyping and commercialization of the combined- accelerated stress testing\r\nsystem for the evaluation of durability of full-size commercial PV modules.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNational Renewable Energy\r\nLaboratory Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: National\r\nRenewable Energy Laboratory \r\n\r\nContact: Bill Hadley; bill.hadley@nrel.gov; (303) 275 3015\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive \r\n\r\nPatent Status: Pending\r\n\r\nNREL tracking number:  19-64\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n ",

TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Nanocomposite Barrier Films for Photovoltaic Applications\r\n\r\nThis Technology Transfer\r\nOpportunity solicits interested companies to license a newly developed and\r\npatented thin film coating that can be used as an encapsulant for photovoltaic\r\nmodule assemblies and barrier coating in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPolymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN)\r\nthin film coatings have improved water vapor and oxygen permeability, in\r\naddition to improved corrosion resistance, while retaining high transparency,\r\nhigh electrical resistivity, and excellent fire-retardant properties for use as\r\nencapsulants for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coatings in other\r\nphotovoltaic applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn these unique composite\r\nmaterials, repeated sequential deposition of solutions of clays (vermiculite,\r\nmontmorillonite, etc.) and solutions of polymers (polyethylenimine,\r\n poly(acrylic acid, etc.) layer with complimentary charged functional\r\ngroups (positive and negative) forms a coating.  The coating can be\r\ndeposited with many various repeating schemes as it is built one layer at a\r\ntime. Once cured, the microstructure resembles a brick and mortar system where\r\nthe clay platelets are the “bricks” and the polymer is the ”mortar”. The facile\r\nand scalable layer-by-layer processing is applicable to many substrates, from\r\nporous and flexible items such as fabrics and foams to hard dense materials\r\nsuch as glass or ceramics.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs an impermeable barrier, the\r\nstructure dictates a tortuous path for oxygen or water molecules to follow,\r\nwhich decreases the water transmission rate by over an order of magnitude\r\nbeyond ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). During a fire, the applied composite coating\r\nreduces the heat rate release, and can act as a flame retardant system.

Floating\r\nSolar-Powered Aeration Systems\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks\r\ninnovations that can advance the application of floating solar-powered aeration\r\nsystems (FSAS) to improve water quality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAeration is the introduction of\r\nair into aquatic systems to support the growth of aerobic bacteria and aquatic\r\nlife. Facilitating the oxidative decomposition of biological materials,\r\naeration can also remove the gaseous products of decomposition, including\r\nammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Many natural systems\r\ndepend upon aeration to maintain a diversity of animal and plant species, as\r\nwell as overall health. However, a surplus of nutrients, restricted mixing and\r\nflow, or significant depth can deplete dissolved oxygen in aqueous systems [1,\r\n2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArtificial aeration has been\r\ndeveloped to address this issue. As a technology, aeration is generally applied\r\nto establish, maintain, or restore sufficient dissolved oxygen to ensure\r\nsuccessful remediation and protection of water resources, including natural\r\nbodies of water (e.g., rivers, lakes) and artificial ones (e.g., fish farms,\r\nlagoons) [2]. Recently, self-powered, autonomous units that combine floating\r\nphotovoltaics and aeration have been implemented to help restore natural water\r\nresources. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications should fall within\r\none of the following three broad areas for ecosystem management on water\r\nsystems: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for environmental restoration and protection of natural\r\nwater systems [1, 2]; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for sustainable water systems for aquaculture [3]; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for sustainable waste bio-processing water systems [4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications for FSAS outside\r\nthese three categories will be considered if they focus on aeration via a\r\nfloating solar-powered system.

Infrastructure systems, including the\r\nelectrical grid and solar generation assets, are vulnerable to weather-related\r\nthreats, cyberattacks, and other disruptive events.

Innovation\r\nin Solar Aesthetics for Residential Photovoltaic Systems\r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for technologies that improve the aesthetic appeal\r\nof photovoltaic systems for use in residential applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile the PV market has continued\r\nto expand rapidly, the rooftop residential market has not grown at the same\r\npace as the utility PV market, as a percentage of added capacity [1]. A survey\r\nof solar installers reported 40% of them consider aesthetics to be key when\r\nrecommending which panels to install [2]. An NREL survey of potential adopters\r\nfound that approximately 30% of people stopped considering PV installations due\r\nto concerns about aesthetics or the impact on the home’s resale value [3].\r\nAnother survey, of residential customers, found customers do not find currently\r\navailable solar products attractive, ranking appearance a priority above\r\nreliability but below efficiency and price [4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the installed\r\ncost per watt has remained high, mainly owing to the slower reduction in\r\nnon-hardware costs for this segment of the market.

"subtopic_description": "h.      Components\r\nfor Gen3 CSP Thermal Transport Systems\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Energy Storage\r\nGrand Challenge [1], this subtopic seeks proposals for the design of components\r\nfor the next generation of Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP) generation\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCSP technologies can be used to\r\ngenerate electricity by converting energy from sunlight to power a turbine.\r\nSETO is developing next generation CSP technologies (Gen3 CSP) which aim to\r\ndeliver heat to a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)-based turbine at or above\r\n700 °C. The Gen3 CSP program [2] identified several heat transfer media (HTM)\r\nthat showed promise in meeting SETO’s electricity cost goals of $0.05/kWh. The\r\nprogram was then organized by the phase of matter for leading HTM— gas, liquid,\r\nor solid. Released in 2017, the Gen3 Roadmap study describes the best\r\nunderstanding of potential Gen3 technologies [3]. Since 2017, additional relevant\r\nresearch and analysis has entered the public domain [4-8]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the candidate\r\nGen3 CSP thermal transport systems are based on:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nChloride salt blends. A mixture of magnesium\r\nchloride, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (MgCl2-NaCl-KCl) is a leading\r\nsalt-based HTM candidate for Gen3. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using\r\nthis HTM in the receiver include catastrophic corrosion in the presence of\r\noxygen or moisture, low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum thermal flux\r\non the leading nickel alloy receivers, and freeze risk. The Gen3 liquid-phase\r\nteam has determined that a liquid sodium receiver is ultimately less risky than\r\na chloride salt receiver with technologies presently available, however, this\r\nsalt remains the leading choice of the Gen3 team to transport energy up and\r\ndown a tower and to act as the thermal energy storage (TES) medium.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nSupercritical fluids. Supercritical carbon\r\ndioxide (sCO2) has been considered as a HTM for the Gen3 gas phase system.\r\nMajor impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include:\r\nhigh-pressure and low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum allowable flux\r\non nickel alloy receivers; high parasitic losses in circulation greatly\r\nimpacted by pressure drop in the receiver; creep and fatigue failure of the\r\nreceiver; and, a higher receiver outlet temperature needed for additional\r\ntemperature drops in indirect thermal energy storage systems (such as particle\r\nbeds). \r\n\r\n·        \r\nParticles. Sand-like particles may avoid\r\nmany of the issues associated with fluid high temperature systems due to the\r\nability to operate at ambient pressure and with limited corrosion or thermal\r\nstability risk. Challenges include: operability limitations; risk of particle\r\ndegradation with time at temperature; scaling limitations; efficiency of heat\r\nexchange in the receiver and primary heater; and general challenges in particle\r\ntransport and mass flow control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo further develop Gen3 CSP\r\nsystems and ensure their feasibility in the market, there is a need to design,\r\nbuild and test Gen3 system components that will be economically viable in\r\nfuture Gen3 plants.

Game\r\nChanging Technologies for Polymer Composites\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Plastics\r\nInnovation Challenge, this subtopic encourages the submission of proposals for\r\ninnovations in polymer composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer\r\ncomposites that have the potential to provide the most significant weight\r\nsavings (up to 60-70%), while offering high specific strength, high specific\r\nstiffness, and excellent chemical/corrosion resistance which are important in a\r\nvehicle operational environment.  Enabling the use of lightweight materials\r\nacross the automotive industry through the development of novel materials,\r\ncomposite preforms and intermediates, manufacturing processes, and components\r\nfor high-volume, high-performance, and affordable polymer composite vehicle\r\napplications is a key enabler for increasing fuel economy and reducing the\r\nenvironmental impact of vehicles. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest within this\r\nsubtopic are as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Multiscale reinforced\r\nlightweight polymer composites: Polymer composites often rely on employing\r\nreinforcements such as micro- or nano-fillers in a relatively soft\r\nmatrix. Simply using a single type of reinforcement (either micro- or\r\nnano-fillers) in polymer composites has almost achieved its reinforcing\r\nlimit.  Multiscale micro/nano hybrid reinforcements are anticipated to\r\nachieve exceptional reinforcing effects, which are beyond the reach of a single\r\ntype of reinforcement. Such hierarchical hybrid fillers are expected to enhance\r\nthe filler/matrix interfacial load transfer.  However, simultaneously\r\nadding both micro- and nano-reinforcements in a polymer matrix material remains\r\nchallenging since nano-fillers tend to loosely adhere (agglomerate) onto\r\nmicro-fillers, decreasing their reinforcing effects [1]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to achieve multiscale (both micro- and nanoscale)\r\nreinforcing effects simultaneously in the polymer matrix. \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of new kinds of fillers with both micro- and\r\nnano-characteristics enabling multiscale reinforcing mechanisms in polymer\r\ncomposites.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Nano-additive enabled\r\nupcycling of polymer composites: Polymer composite vehicle structures/parts\r\nare required to be recycled for reuse.  Converting polymer composites into\r\na value-added product will significantly reduce the amount of plastic that\r\nbecomes landfill or environmental pollution. The recycled composites often\r\nexhibit degradation in both properties and functionalities. Upcycling is\r\nneeded to restore the recycled composites to achieve the same or even superior\r\nproperties and functionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts\r\n[2]. Nano-additives are anticipated to offer an intriguing upcycling\r\nopportunity through reinforcing matrix and/or tailoring filler/matrix interface\r\nto achieve a higher load-transfer efficiency. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to upcycle polymer composites by adding low-cost\r\nnano-fillers in recycled composites.  \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of low-cost nano-additives capable of restoring\r\nrecycled composites to achieve the same or even superior properties and\r\nfunctionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must tie in with\r\nstructural polymer composites that have advantages of low cost, lightweight,\r\nand high performance for vehicle applications. Any proposals using above\r\ntechnologies to develop or improve battery materials performance will not be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Felix Wu, felix.wu@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Reliable,\r\nDurable, Low-Cost Sensors for Advanced Combustion and Emission Control\r\nStrategies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop sensors for engine combustion and after treatment systems that offer\r\na significant decrease in cost while demonstrating durability, as well as improved\r\nspeed and accuracy that enable new combustion strategies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced combustion engines that\r\nincrease fuel economy while meeting increasingly stringent emission regulations\r\nwill require innovative control strategies. Such control strategies need a\r\nvariety of accurate and timely inputs. Sensors which measure important inputs\r\nlike temperature, pressure, fuel-air ratio, fuel quality, and piston and valve\r\nposition, as well as reliably detect pollutants at all operating conditions\r\nwould be installed on future engines and used for combustion control and active\r\nfeedback. While various sensor options are currently available, significant\r\nreductions in cost and increased durability are needed to be widely\r\nimplemented.

"subtopic_description": "c.       Game\r\nChanging Technologies for Polymer Composites\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Plastics\r\nInnovation Challenge, this subtopic encourages the submission of proposals for\r\ninnovations in polymer composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer\r\ncomposites that have the potential to provide the most significant weight\r\nsavings (up to 60-70%), while offering high specific strength, high specific\r\nstiffness, and excellent chemical/corrosion resistance which are important in a\r\nvehicle operational environment.  Enabling the use of lightweight materials\r\nacross the automotive industry through the development of novel materials,\r\ncomposite preforms and intermediates, manufacturing processes, and components\r\nfor high-volume, high-performance, and affordable polymer composite vehicle\r\napplications is a key enabler for increasing fuel economy and reducing the\r\nenvironmental impact of vehicles. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest within this\r\nsubtopic are as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Multiscale reinforced\r\nlightweight polymer composites: Polymer composites often rely on employing\r\nreinforcements such as micro- or nano-fillers in a relatively soft\r\nmatrix. Simply using a single type of reinforcement (either micro- or\r\nnano-fillers) in polymer composites has almost achieved its reinforcing\r\nlimit.  Multiscale micro/nano hybrid reinforcements are anticipated to\r\nachieve exceptional reinforcing effects, which are beyond the reach of a single\r\ntype of reinforcement. Such hierarchical hybrid fillers are expected to enhance\r\nthe filler/matrix interfacial load transfer.  However, simultaneously\r\nadding both micro- and nano-reinforcements in a polymer matrix material remains\r\nchallenging since nano-fillers tend to loosely adhere (agglomerate) onto\r\nmicro-fillers, decreasing their reinforcing effects [1]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to achieve multiscale (both micro- and nanoscale)\r\nreinforcing effects simultaneously in the polymer matrix. \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of new kinds of fillers with both micro- and\r\nnano-characteristics enabling multiscale reinforcing mechanisms in polymer\r\ncomposites.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Nano-additive enabled\r\nupcycling of polymer composites: Polymer composite vehicle structures/parts\r\nare required to be recycled for reuse.  Converting polymer composites into\r\na value-added product will significantly reduce the amount of plastic that\r\nbecomes landfill or environmental pollution. The recycled composites often\r\nexhibit degradation in both properties and functionalities. Upcycling is\r\nneeded to restore the recycled composites to achieve the same or even superior\r\nproperties and functionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts\r\n[2]. Nano-additives are anticipated to offer an intriguing upcycling\r\nopportunity through reinforcing matrix and/or tailoring filler/matrix interface\r\nto achieve a higher load-transfer efficiency. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to upcycle polymer composites by adding low-cost\r\nnano-fillers in recycled composites.  \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of low-cost nano-additives capable of restoring\r\nrecycled composites to achieve the same or even superior properties and\r\nfunctionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must tie in with\r\nstructural polymer composites that have advantages of low cost, lightweight,\r\nand high performance for vehicle applications.

WPTO pioneers research and\r\ndevelopment efforts in both marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) and hydropower\r\ntechnologies to improve performance, lower cost and ultimately support the\r\nUnited States' ability to sustainably meet its growing energy demand. MHK\r\ntechnologies capture energy from waves, tides, ocean, and river currents, as\r\nwell as from ocean thermal gradients. Hydropower and MHK technologies generate\r\nrenewable electricity that supports domestic economic prosperity and energy\r\nsecurity while enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the US power grid. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor FY 2021 solicitation, WPTO is seeking applications for\r\nMHK technologies only. MHK technologies are at an early stage of development\r\nbecause of the fundamental challenges of generating power from dynamic,\r\nlow-velocity, and high-density waves and currents, while surviving in corrosive\r\nmarine environments. These challenges are intensified by high costs and lengthy\r\npermitting processes associated with in-water testing. To achieve the mission\r\nand help to realize the vision, the MHK Program must support research and\r\ndevelopment (R&D) efforts that lead to significant reductions in the cost\r\nof MHK energy that enable industry to be competitive in U.S. electricity\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to ether subtopic must: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nPropose a tightly structured program which includes technical\r\nmilestones that demonstrate clear progress, are aggressive but achievable, and\r\nare quantitative;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude projections for price and/or performance improvements\r\nthat are tied to a baseline;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nExplicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation\r\nwith respect to existing commercially available products or solutions; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude a preliminary cost analysis; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nJustify all performance claims with theoretical predictions\r\nand/or relevant experimental data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNote: In addition to the sub-topics (a) and (b) below, WPTO\r\nis supporting subtopic e under Topic 20 – Joint Topic: CABLE Materials and\r\nApplications entitled Electric Systems—Generators and Motors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought only in the following\r\nsubtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Co-Development\r\nof Marine Energy Technology at Smaller Scales (CMETTS)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for\r\nthe development and design of new marine energy prototypes specific to the\r\nneeds of an identified end user in the blue economy. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCMETSS seeks to advance near-term\r\nmarine energy opportunities in the blue economy by supporting the development\r\nof solutions tightly coupled to end-user needs. Specifically, this subtopic\r\nseeks to support the development of industry projects that link marine energy\r\ntechnologies together with blue economy energy end users to co-develop\r\nsolutions specific to energy constraints.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA common underlying input for many\r\nof the activities in the blue economy is energy: fuel for ships, batteries for\r\nunderwater vehicles, or high-pressure seawater for desalination systems. While\r\nsome activities have access to cheap and reliable sources of energy, others do\r\nnot. Energy inaccessibility limits operations and adds unnecessary costs.\r\nRemoving or reducing these energy constraints through energy innovation could\r\nopen new pathways for sustainable economic development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecognizing this opportunity and\r\nthe potential for marine energy to ease energy constraints, WPTO released a\r\nreport in 2019 titled “Powering the Blue Economy: Exploring Opportunities for\r\nMarine Renewable Energy in Maritime Markets” [1]. The report describes eight\r\nnon-grid applications where marine energy could provide consistent, reliable\r\npower. This report serves as the foundation for the recently launched Powering\r\nthe Blue Economy Initiative that supports R&D for non-grid applications of\r\nmarine and hydrokinetic energy. Blue economy markets present new opportunities\r\nand unfamiliar applications of marine and hydrokinetic energy technology\r\ndevelopers. Upfront engagement with end-users and coastal communities is\r\nessential to successful technology integration to achieve design goals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, applications of marine\r\nenergy are not limited to electricity generation and can include marine energy\r\nfor propulsion or pumping. The CMETSS topic is market agnostic but requires\r\nSBIR Phase I applicants to make a case for their proposed application through\r\nan initial analysis of the market’s value and broader impact in their proposal.\r\nShould the project be awarded, a more refined market analysis will be required\r\nas a deliverable during the period of performance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn FY 2021, applicants to this\r\nsubtopic are strongly encouraged to explore new co-development topics that are not\r\nduplicative with other efforts underway with WPTO such as the Ocean Observing\r\nPrize DEVELOP Competition [2] focused on wave energy powered rechargeable\r\nautonomous underwater vehicles and solutions fit for the Waves to Water Prize\r\n[3] developing wave energy powered desalination suited for disaster relief and\r\nrecovery. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest including and\r\nbeyond applications cited in the Powering the Blue Economy report can include,\r\nbut are not limited to, lightweight devices, short duration deployments, disposable\r\nmaterials, or other novel and innovative features.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicants must identify and\r\ndemonstrate at least one end-user whom they will work with during the project.\r\nWPTO encourages engaging with end users to understand their power requirements\r\nand the functional requirements required. As an example, of the type of\r\nengagements the program has done with end-users, please see the published\r\n“Enabling Power at Sea: Opportunities for Expanded Ocean Observations through\r\nMarine Renewable Energy Integration” [4]. The identified end-use partner(s) may\r\nbe listed as project participant(s). Applicants must demonstrate that a\r\nprototype, with an identified partner, can be designed and built with funds\r\nprovided in Phase II. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn assessment of the proposed\r\nmarine and hydrokinetic resource necessary for energy harvesting for the\r\ntechnology should be provided in the Phase I application and refined during the\r\nperiod of performance. While the system should be designed for a particular\r\nend-user for the purpose of this solicitation, the solution should demonstrate\r\npotential for applicability for other applications or purposes. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is expected that Phase I work\r\nwould be centered on end-user and customer discovery for the proposed concept;\r\ncollecting end-user or customer requirements; converting collected customer\r\nrequirements into system design requirements; using those design requirements\r\nto inform preliminary prototype design; and performing preliminary\r\nproof-of-concept testing or modeling of system components. One of the\r\ndeliverables for Phase I will include a table of design specifications for the\r\nsystem and how each relates to a customer need. In Phase II, the awardee(s)\r\nwill refine system designs based on the findings from Phase I and proceed to\r\nbuild a functioning prototype to be tested and/or deployed. Phase II awardees\r\nmust also present a detailed plan for technology commercialization. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Phase I proposals, competitive\r\napplicants should demonstrate knowledge, experience, and/or capabilities in\r\ndeveloping marine technologies and include the following in their proposals: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nA preliminary design of the proposed system with estimated\r\nphysical dimensions;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA clear description on how the system would function;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nThe end-user or customers that will be engaged during the\r\nproject;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nIdentification of the marine energy resource that would be\r\nutilized;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nThe method or methods by which customer needs will be converted\r\ninto design requirements or specifications, for example: Quality Function\r\nDeployment, Design Structure Matrix, Kano Method, or Axiomatic Design; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nIdentification and description of the proposed performance\r\nmetrics which will be used to assess the system in comparison to incumbent\r\ntechnologies, such as levelized cost of energy, levelized avoided cost of\r\nenergy, or other similar metrics.

Low-Cost,\r\nUser-Friendly Monitoring Tools for MHK Sites\r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the\r\ndevelopment of novel methods for environmental monitoring and/or resource\r\ncharacterization at MHK sites that are very low cost and very easy to use. \r\nThis may include hardware/sensing packages, methodologies, and/or\r\nsoftware/analysis tools.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUncertainty regarding\r\nenvironmental impacts of MHK devices has resulted in extensive baseline and\r\npost installation monitoring requirements, which can be difficult and expensive\r\nto fulfil with existing environmental monitoring technologies. Many existing\r\nenvironmental monitoring technologies are not designed for or validated for use\r\nin locations relevant to MHK. Meanwhile, monitoring efforts for resource\r\ncharacterization face similar challenges, especially for small scale,\r\ndistributed MHK applications. Additionally, to detect what are anticipated to\r\nbe rare extreme events, most monitoring systems produce large data streams\r\nwhich must then be extensively and complexly processed and analyzed. Previous\r\nresearch and development have made substantial improvements in the technical\r\nperformance of monitoring technologies in MHK environments, yet the costs\r\nassociated with data collection are still prohibitive, and analysis often needs\r\nto be performed by a technical specialist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of particular interest\r\ninclude, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetection of collision of fish, marine mammals, or diving\r\nseabirds with tidal turbines.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nCollision of marine animals with tidal turbines. While this is\r\nbelieved to be a rare event and there have been limited observations of\r\norganisms being struck by or colliding with tidal turbines, there remains a\r\nlimited ability to observe animals near a turbine, and collision occurrence\r\nrates and outcomes have not been well established.  \r\n\r\n·        \r\nMeasurement of baseline and changes in noise, currents, or wave\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nIdentification of baseline conditions for ambient noise and\r\nphysical systems such as currents and/or the wave climate. As part of\r\npermitting, MHK projects are often required to identify such baseline\r\nconditions and quantify if and how installation and operation of their device\r\nalters the soundscape and physical systems.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLeveraging or modifying existing MHK device performance\r\nmonitoring technology for environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA possible strategy for lowering cost, complexity, and effort is\r\nto harness existing monitoring and adapt it for other needs. If a variable,\r\ne.g. noise, is being monitored for device performance, perhaps some\r\nmodifications could be made such that data collected for device monitoring\r\ncould additionally serve site monitoring, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEnvironmental monitoring or resource characterization approaches\r\nspecifically suited to small scale, distributed MHK, supporting Powering the\r\nBlue Economy initiatives.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLow-cost, user-friendly solutions for MHK monitoring. Smaller\r\nscale projects often have smaller scale budgets and personnel. Ideally\r\nsolutions would apply or be adaptable to multiple project types and/or\r\ngeographic regions, although especially creative and impactful solutions with a\r\nnarrow focus could also be of interest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA key consideration for this topic\r\narea is the creation of very low cost and very user-friendly monitoring tools\r\nand methodologies. Proposed systems should strive to reduce the cost of\r\ninstrumentation and data collection by 50 percent as compared to current technologies\r\nand methodologies. Additionally, any tools or methodologies should be\r\nexecutable by personnel with basic training, and output data should be in a\r\nformat and units that are readily understandable by MHK project teams and\r\nregulators, and directly address key environmental and/or resource questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Phase I applicants will:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProduce a final design of the proposed technology or methodology;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProduce a refined drawing or schematic of the proposed system;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelop a description of the cost associated with current\r\ntechnologies used for specified data collection and cost target for proposed\r\ntechnology at commercialization;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProvide detailed description of the level of training needed to\r\noperate the monitoring instrumentation and analyze data;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProvide a description and/or example of the final data output\r\ncreated by the monitoring technology and discuss how the data output addresses\r\nthe needs of the target audiences;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProvide details of work to be performed in Phase 1 including\r\nrequired resources and technical performance targets;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nFabrication of a working prototype (for new methodologies and\r\nadaptations of existing technologies); Fabrication of a key component (for new\r\ntechnologies and new instruments)\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPerform proof of concept testing of prototype or component in a\r\nlab or tank setting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase II will include, but is not\r\nlimited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nFabrication of a working prototype;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nRigorous testing of the technology in a relevant MHK environment;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA detailed plan for commercialization of the proposed technology.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above\r\nrequirements for Phase I, competitive applicants should demonstrate knowledge,\r\nexperience, and/or capabilities in developing monitoring technologies for the\r\nmarine environment and include the following in their application: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nA preliminary design of the proposed system and a clear\r\ndescription on how the system would operate;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA drawing or schematic of the proposed system; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nA cost estimate for the proposed system and comparison to costs\r\nfor existing state of the art technologies; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nAn estimate of the level of training needed to operate the\r\nproposed monitoring instrumentation and analyze resulting data;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA conceptualized or actual example of the proposed output data;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTeam members or external advisors with essential expertise\r\nrelating to both MHK and environmental monitoring / resource characterization \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Rajesh Dham, Rajesh.Dham@EE.Doe.Gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nCopping, A.E. and Hemery, L.G., editors. “OES-Environmental\r\n2020 State of the Science Report: Environmental Effects of Marine Renewable\r\nEnergy Development Around the World.” Report for Ocean Energy\r\nSystems (OES).

"subtopic_description": "a.      Co-Development\r\nof Marine Energy Technology at Smaller Scales (CMETTS)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for\r\nthe development and design of new marine energy prototypes specific to the\r\nneeds of an identified end user in the blue economy. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCMETSS seeks to advance near-term\r\nmarine energy opportunities in the blue economy by supporting the development\r\nof solutions tightly coupled to end-user needs. Specifically, this subtopic\r\nseeks to support the development of industry projects that link marine energy\r\ntechnologies together with blue economy energy end users to co-develop\r\nsolutions specific to energy constraints.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA common underlying input for many\r\nof the activities in the blue economy is energy: fuel for ships, batteries for\r\nunderwater vehicles, or high-pressure seawater for desalination systems. While\r\nsome activities have access to cheap and reliable sources of energy, others do\r\nnot. Energy inaccessibility limits operations and adds unnecessary costs.\r\nRemoving or reducing these energy constraints through energy innovation could\r\nopen new pathways for sustainable economic development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecognizing this opportunity and\r\nthe potential for marine energy to ease energy constraints, WPTO released a\r\nreport in 2019 titled “Powering the Blue Economy: Exploring Opportunities for\r\nMarine Renewable Energy in Maritime Markets” [1]. The report describes eight\r\nnon-grid applications where marine energy could provide consistent, reliable\r\npower. This report serves as the foundation for the recently launched Powering\r\nthe Blue Economy Initiative that supports R&D for non-grid applications of\r\nmarine and hydrokinetic energy. Blue economy markets present new opportunities\r\nand unfamiliar applications of marine and hydrokinetic energy technology\r\ndevelopers. Upfront engagement with end-users and coastal communities is\r\nessential to successful technology integration to achieve design goals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, applications of marine\r\nenergy are not limited to electricity generation and can include marine energy\r\nfor propulsion or pumping. The CMETSS topic is market agnostic but requires\r\nSBIR Phase I applicants to make a case for their proposed application through\r\nan initial analysis of the market’s value and broader impact in their proposal.\r\nShould the project be awarded, a more refined market analysis will be required\r\nas a deliverable during the period of performance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn FY 2021, applicants to this\r\nsubtopic are strongly encouraged to explore new co-development topics that are not\r\nduplicative with other efforts underway with WPTO such as the Ocean Observing\r\nPrize DEVELOP Competition [2] focused on wave energy powered rechargeable\r\nautonomous underwater vehicles and solutions fit for the Waves to Water Prize\r\n[3] developing wave energy powered desalination suited for disaster relief and\r\nrecovery. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest including and\r\nbeyond applications cited in the Powering the Blue Economy report can include,\r\nbut are not limited to, lightweight devices, short duration deployments, disposable\r\nmaterials, or other novel and innovative features.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicants must identify and\r\ndemonstrate at least one end-user whom they will work with during the project.\r\nWPTO encourages engaging with end users to understand their power requirements\r\nand the functional requirements required. As an example, of the type of\r\nengagements the program has done with end-users, please see the published\r\n“Enabling Power at Sea: Opportunities for Expanded Ocean Observations through\r\nMarine Renewable Energy Integration” [4]. The identified end-use partner(s) may\r\nbe listed as project participant(s). Applicants must demonstrate that a\r\nprototype, with an identified partner, can be designed and built with funds\r\nprovided in Phase II. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn assessment of the proposed\r\nmarine and hydrokinetic resource necessary for energy harvesting for the\r\ntechnology should be provided in the Phase I application and refined during the\r\nperiod of performance. While the system should be designed for a particular\r\nend-user for the purpose of this solicitation, the solution should demonstrate\r\npotential for applicability for other applications or purposes. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is expected that Phase I work\r\nwould be centered on end-user and customer discovery for the proposed concept;\r\ncollecting end-user or customer requirements; converting collected customer\r\nrequirements into system design requirements; using those design requirements\r\nto inform preliminary prototype design; and performing preliminary\r\nproof-of-concept testing or modeling of system components. One of the\r\ndeliverables for Phase I will include a table of design specifications for the\r\nsystem and how each relates to a customer need. In Phase II, the awardee(s)\r\nwill refine system designs based on the findings from Phase I and proceed to\r\nbuild a functioning prototype to be tested and/or deployed. Phase II awardees\r\nmust also present a detailed plan for technology commercialization. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Phase I proposals, competitive\r\napplicants should demonstrate knowledge, experience, and/or capabilities in\r\ndeveloping marine technologies and include the following in their proposals: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nA preliminary design of the proposed system with estimated\r\nphysical dimensions;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA clear description on how the system would function;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nThe end-user or customers that will be engaged during the\r\nproject;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nIdentification of the marine energy resource that would be\r\nutilized;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nThe method or methods by which customer needs will be converted\r\ninto design requirements or specifications, for example: Quality Function\r\nDeployment, Design Structure Matrix, Kano Method, or Axiomatic Design; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nIdentification and description of the proposed performance\r\nmetrics which will be used to assess the system in comparison to incumbent\r\ntechnologies, such as levelized cost of energy, levelized avoided cost of\r\nenergy, or other similar metrics. Please refer to “Existing Ocean Energy\r\nPerformance Metrics” for examples [5];\r\n\r\n·        \r\nA description of the intended deployment location(s) and the\r\navailable energy in the chosen marine energy resource, including identification\r\nof any key environmental, social, and regulatory challenges;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nThe state-of-the-art for incumbent technologies and how the\r\nproposed design is an improvement in performance or reduction in cost; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of work to be performed in Phase I including resources\r\nrequired and intended performance targets; and \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInitial description of Phase II work including the scale of the\r\ndemonstration prototype, the intended test location or facility, and potential\r\nend-user partners.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Rajesh Dham, Rajesh.Dham@EE.Doe.Gov \r\n",

WETO plans and executes a\r\ndiversified portfolio of research and development to advance technologies for\r\noffshore, land-based, and distributed wind energy, as well as its integration\r\nwith the electric grid. WETO also supports research to understand wind-related\r\nsiting and environmental challenges. WETO’s R&D program pursues three\r\noverarching objectives: (a) reduce the cost of wind energy for all wind\r\napplications; (b) enable the integration of substantial amounts of wind energy\r\nreliably and resiliently into the dynamic and rapidly evolving national energy\r\nsystem, including integrated systems with other renewable energy and energy\r\nstorage; and (c) create siting and environmental solutions to reduce\r\nenvironmental impacts and facilitate responsible wind energy development. WETO\r\ninvests in both land-based and offshore wind power at the utility scale as well\r\nas systems on the distribution side and focuses on novel research not being\r\nundertaken by the U.S. wind industry due to perceived cost, risk, or focus on\r\nnear-term investment returns.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWind energy is an important part of the U.S. energy mix. In\r\n2020, there are over 100 gigawatts (GW) of land-based, utility-scale wind\r\ninstalled across 41 states [7], supplying seven percent of U.S. electricity\r\nsupply [4]. The U.S. has over 85,000 wind turbines in distributed wind\r\napplications across 50 states [2]. A nascent offshore wind industry is\r\nbeginning to develop—driven by federal offshore wind lease auctions,\r\ncomplementary state policies, technology innovation, and falling wind turbine\r\nprices—but challenged by unique characteristics of U.S. waters. While\r\nutility-scale land-based wind technology is relatively mature, the phase out of\r\nthe Production Tax Credit in 2020 highlights the importance of continued\r\nresearch and innovation to reduce costs further, so that wind energy can\r\ncompete and add value to the grid on an unsubsidized basis. Additionally, many\r\nremaining sites where wind could be deployed are constrained by an array of\r\nenvironmental and siting concerns. Finally, wind energy’s growth has brought\r\nattention to the need for advanced technology and controls to support grid\r\nresilience and integration of wind with other energy technologies.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWETO aims to advance scientific knowledge and technological\r\ninnovation to enable clean, low-cost wind energy options nationwide.

Though the expanding market for solar power\r\nconverters has resulted in technical advancements for solar PV, significant\r\ndifferences in the technical requirements between distributed wind and solar\r\ntechnologies make them suboptimal for use with distributed wind applications.\r\nIn addition to advanced power converters for standalone distributed wind systems,\r\nadvanced power converters for wind-hybrid – wind, solar, storage – distributed\r\nenergy systems are also needed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicants are asked to address\r\nthe tradeoff between developing turbine controls with power conversion in one\r\ncombined system compared to physically separating these functions.

TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Wind Turbine Blade Design for Small Wakes\r\n\r\nThis is a Technology Transfer\r\nOpportunity to license and commercialize a wind turbine blade technology\r\ndeveloped and patented by DOE’s Sandia National Laboratories (SNL).  The small\r\nwake rotor design patent (US\r\nPatent 10,400,743) describes a wind turbine blade design that has a less\r\nstable wake than the typical maximum efficiency aerodynamic design. By slightly\r\nchanging the axial induction, an important aerodynamic performance parameter of\r\na wind turbine, the wind in the rotor wake recovers to the freestream airspeed\r\nmore quickly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWind turbine blades that are\r\ndesigned to create wakes that dissipate more rapidly have the potential to\r\nreduce down-turbine turbulence and concomitant wake effects on other turbines.\r\nThis can reduce capital costs for commercial wind development by allowing wind\r\nturbines to be spaced closer together and reducing the power production losses\r\nfrom the wake effects. This, in turn, could potentially reduce the land or sea\r\nfootprint of a wind plant by as much as half, with additional spillover\r\nbenefits from reducing balance-of-plant costs. A blade design recently patented\r\nby SNL creates a faster-mixing wake that can advance these goals.  The new\r\nblade technology could be applied to new wind projects, and to repowering of\r\nolder wind farms to reduce array losses and increase Annual Energy Production.\r\nThe repower market is expected to be $25 billion through 2030 [3].

Please refer to each office’s specific\r\ntopics for more information about each office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe use of electricity in the U.S. and worldwide is\r\ncurrently undergoing multiple paradigms shifts in how electricity is generated,\r\ndelivered, and consumed [2, 3]. There is a critical need for advances in the\r\nmaterials and means by which electricity is translated from generation to use.\r\nThe demand for CABLE materials and applications are increasing as sectors\r\nbecome increasingly electrified [4]. In addition, there is an urgent need to\r\nupgrade electric systems for greater grid reliability because of increasing\r\nrenewables and distributed energy resources (DERs), and resilience from\r\nevolving threats such as cyber-attacks and extreme weather offers a once in a\r\nlifetime window of opportunity to upgrade the fundamental materials and\r\napplications that support it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile DOE has funded research on high conductivity materials\r\nbefore, the comprehensive CABLE approach mandates that a breakthrough in\r\nelectrical or thermal conductivity be balanced with maintenance of other\r\nproperties needed for applications above a certain minimum value, with minimum\r\nstandards described in the application specific subtopics below. Furthermore,\r\nthe CABLE material and its applications must be sufficiently broad and affordable\r\nthat it enables leapfrogging international competitors and fostering a host of\r\nnew manufacturing industries to make higher performing materials and the\r\nproducts—everything from transmission and electric vehicle (EV) cables to solar\r\ncells—enabled by them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis topic supports the objectives of the Energy Storage\r\nGrand Challenge, Grid Modernization Initiative, and DOE’s support for Advanced\r\nManufacturing as part of its support for to advance the Industries of the\r\nFuture. Advancements in CABLE materials also support the objectives of the\r\nCritical Minerals Initiative. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis topic comprises two distinct, complementary focuses\r\ncritical to achieve the CABLE objectives. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCABLE materials innovations are the subject of\r\nsubtopic a) where enhancing conductivity—a “breakthrough, leapfrog” improvement\r\ncompared to state of the art—must be balanced by meeting all applicable minimum\r\nstandards for future commercialization of applications (including subtopics\r\nb-h). Note that the nano-carbon infusion approach of subtopic a is only one of\r\nmany promising approaches (many of which also involve the use of critical\r\nmaterials) to make CABLE materials [5, 6, 7, 8,9].  Proposals for research on\r\napproaches other than that in subtopic a) are not, however, being sought under\r\nthis Topic at this time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCABLE applications (subtopics b-h) should include\r\nenhanced conductivity materials (from subtopic a) or other new materials [5 ,6,\r\n7, 8] that meet or exceed metrics specified for each application and to the\r\ncurrent state of the art. Even though these applications appear prosaic where\r\nsubstantial R&D effort has been made previously, the CABLE applications\r\nlisted below, all have the potential to be Breakthrough and Leapfrog because\r\nfor the first time the research includes re-designing for enhanced conductivity\r\nmaterial—something never done before—and exploring the manufacturing and\r\nregulatory barriers involved in the use of such materials in pervasive\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEnhanced conductivity materials NOT of interest (or\r\napplications that rely on them) include:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nStandard superconducting materials;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nHigh-temperature superconducting materials; and \r\n\r\n·        \r\nPrimarily magnetic materials;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProposals that focus on these materials will be deemed\r\nnonresponsive to this topic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll proposals to this topic must:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPropose a tightly structured program which includes clear,\r\nCABLE-relevant technical milestones/ timeline that demonstrate clear progress,\r\nare aggressive but achievable, and are quantitative;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProvide evidence that the proposer has relevant CABLE and/or\r\nOE/EERE experience and \r\n\r\ncapability;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nClearly define metrics and expected deliverables;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nExplain applications of project output and potential for future\r\ncommercialization;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude projections for cost and/or performance improvements that\r\nare tied to a clearly defined baseline and/or state of the art products or\r\npractices; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nExplicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation\r\nwith respect to existing commercially available products or solutions; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude an energy savings impact and impact grid as well as a\r\npreliminary cost analysis; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nReport all relevant performance metrics; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nJustify all performance claims with theoretical predictions\r\nand/or relevant experimental data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Phase I application should detail material, design\r\nand/or bench scale systems that are scalable to a subsequent Phase II prototype\r\ndevelopment. Applications must be responsive to the following subtopics.\r\nApplications outside of these subtopic areas will not be considered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Metal-carbon composition and composites manufacturing\r\n(CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic is the only one in\r\nthis topic to focus on the conductivity enhanced materials part of the CABLE\r\neffort. This subtopic seeks proposals to commercialize the innovation in CABLE\r\nmaterials manufacturing presented in the May 2020 patent and related patent\r\napplications from Argonne National Laboratory listed below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe patent solves one of the\r\ntechnical problems for manufacturing high purity, oxygen-free metal-carbon\r\ncomposites with an electric current. These carbon-infused “covetic” metal\r\nalloys might lead to significant energy savings and performance improvements in\r\nvarious applications (e.g., high-voltage electrical transmission, electrical\r\nmotors and generators, advanced heat exchangers, electrodes for fuel cells,\r\nbatteries, supercapacitors, and for thermal management in micro- and power\r\nelectronics). This fabrication method allows precise control of the composition\r\nof the covetic material to be produced. The method described herein also can be\r\napplied to produce multi-element-carbon composites within a metal or alloy\r\nmatrix, including high melting temperature materials such as ceramic particles\r\nor prefabricated nano- or micro-structures, such as carbon nanotubes or\r\ngraphene compounds. The covetic reaction between metal and carbon takes place\r\nunder the influence of flowing electrons through the melted metal-carbon\r\nprecursor. This process posited to create strong bonding between nanocarbon\r\nstructure and the metal elements in the melt.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe 2019 patent application is for\r\nthe initial version of the method to make covetic metal-nanostructured carbon\r\ncomposites or compositions. The method comprises the introduction of carbon\r\ninto a molten metal in a heated reactor under low oxygen partial pressure, and\r\nthe passing of an electric current through the molten metal.

Electricity\r\nDelivery System Applications (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits innovative\r\nresearch and development (R&D) proposals that can enable breakthrough\r\napplications to better secure the national grid and make efficiency and\r\naffordability improvements to electricity delivery system (EDS) infrastructure.\r\nThis subtopic is being jointly supported by the Office of Electricity and the\r\nEERE Advanced Manufacturing Office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe U.S. electricity delivery\r\nsystem is currently undergoing a transformation as the importance of grid\r\nreliability and resilience is realized in the face of evolving threats\r\n(including cyber-attacks and extreme weather), and state and local policies\r\nincrease penetration of renewable energy and distributed energy resources\r\n(DERs). To ensure reliable and secure electricity delivery in the future grid\r\nthrough these changes, technological advancements in transmission &\r\ndistribution (T&D) infrastructure must be made [1]. Specifically,\r\nimprovements are required in T&D infrastructure, and at their most\r\nfundamental, the material that transports power: conductors, and their\r\napplication in transmission cables.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals to\r\nintegrate affordable high-performance conductors into transmission and\r\ndistribution applications to provide numerous benefits to EDS and other\r\npower-carrying applications (including overhead, underground and underwater\r\ncables). Lines or cables with significantly improved conductivity yield\r\ntransmission benefits including minimized losses, increased strength, reduced\r\nsag and improved carrying capacity, all of which improve performance and\r\noperations. Improved-performance conductors promise immense benefits to all\r\nsystem stakeholders [2]. To the grid operator, the benefits from installing\r\nadvanced lines and cables include increased grid reliability and resilience. To\r\nthe customer, use of such lines and cables results in significant cost savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this subtopic\r\nis to design a proof-of-concept conductor for medium- to long- distance\r\ntransmission lines and cables. In performing this design research, both desired\r\nproperties and design specifications must be considered. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesired properties of conductors\r\nfor EDS applications include [3]:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLow resistance to minimize electricity loss.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved mechanical strength for maximized reliability.\r\n\r\no  \r\nImproved tensile strength.\r\n\r\no  \r\nImproved mechanical bend fatigue performance.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved thermal conductivity.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved melting points to maintain high operational strength.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nHigh ductility for mechanical flexibility.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEarth-abundant content for minimized cost.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nRecyclable and safe material end-of-life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaximizing one or several of these\r\nproperties in the proposed conductor design is a priority of this subtopic. In\r\naddition, proposals to this subtopic must explain how they support OE’s goals\r\nfor innovative transmission reliability, resilient distribution systems, energy\r\nstorage, and advanced grid components.  Proposals are encouraged to draw upon\r\nAMO-sponsored innovations in advanced material manufacturing, particularly for\r\nhigh performance conductors. Advanced manufacturing approaches such as additive\r\nmanufacturing and roll-to-roll are encouraged where appropriate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUse of a breakthrough in one\r\nproperty must be complemented by maintaining the other properties above minimum\r\naccepted values, with minimum standards described in each area of interest\r\nbelow. This is to balance a “breakthrough, leapfrog” improvement with minimums\r\nthat support applicability and future commercialization. Expected improvements\r\nin metrics and how the improvements compare to the current state of the art\r\nmust be clearly stated in proposals in response to this subtopic. Designs\r\nshould maximize economic performance, demonstrate financial viability, and\r\nestablish a credible pathway to commercialization. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA related consideration is meeting\r\nexternal design parameters. Rural utilities and co-operatives generally rely on\r\nUSDA Rural Utility Service (RUS) specifications (and minimum accepted values)\r\nfor designing and implementing electric infrastructure in their jurisdiction.\r\nDesigning conductors that may be used in these areas removes one barrier from\r\nfuture commercialization potential. Properties of interest in these standards\r\nare more practical for the electric delivery application and include:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nOperating voltage\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLine current\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConductor Size\r\n\r\n·        \r\nMax operating temperature\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLine voltage drop\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPower losses\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe specific standards may be\r\nfound at: https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/UEP_Bulletin_1724E-200.pdf\r\n[4]. The linked standards detail aboveground cables specifically, but RUS also\r\npublishes standards for other applications, including underground cables.\r\nFollowing federal standards in designing these conductors may benefit future\r\ncommercialization opportunities and will make the project more appealing to a\r\nwider market. While it is not strictly required to meet any specific set of RUS\r\nstandards, or every single standard in this research, keeping them in mind\r\nwhile designing an advanced conductor proof-of-concept will be favorably viewed\r\nby reviewers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest for this topic\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n1.  Aluminum-Based Conductors:\r\nAluminum is primarily used for overhead transmission lines, as it provides\r\nhigh-conductivity and light-weight benefits for low cost. The most common\r\naluminum-based conductors are aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR), but\r\nother on-the-market options include ACCC, ACCR, and ACSS. As a material,\r\naluminum has potential for overhead lines, and advanced manufacturing methods\r\nmay yield unique advancements for aluminum-based conductors [5]. Table 1\r\ndescribes desired minimum values for several properties of the proof-of-concept\r\naluminum-based conductor. Due to the variable nature of properties of\r\ndifferently sized conductors, precise values may change depending on size and\r\nampacity chosen of the conductor design. As stated earlier, these thresholds\r\nare approximate guidelines for property thresholds to maximize\r\ncommercialization potential in the future; it is expected that the design meets\r\nCABLE goals with an affordable, breakthrough, and leapfrog design.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  Property\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Desired Threshold\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Notes\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Electrical conductivity\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  > 62% IACS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Mechanical strength\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Comparable to or stronger than that of on-the-market ACSR\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Precise value may change depending on line rating\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Resistance\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  < 0.2 Ω/1000ft\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  DC at 20°C\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Ductility\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Comparable to or stronger than that of on-the-market ACSR\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Precise value may change depending on line rating\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Cost \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Should not exceed $2/foot finished product\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  May be substantially lower depending on line rating and\r\n  manufacturing methods\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Copper-Based Conductors:\r\nCopper-based conductors benefit from high conductivity and high strength but\r\nsuffer from higher weight and costs. For medium- to long- distance\r\ntransmission, these properties may make copper apt for underground or underwater\r\napplications, because the higher conductivity and strength increase reliability\r\nand efficiency. Aluminum-based conductors are by far the most common conductors\r\nfor transmission applications, and thus there are fewer preferred requirements\r\nfor a copper-based conductor. The proposed design should achieve over 100% IACS\r\nand must display viable application for undersea or underground cabling. Of\r\nutmost importance are minimizing cost while maximizing strength and\r\nconductivity. Discussing demonstrated viability for transmission application\r\nthat may lead to future commercialization will help in the proposal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Other EDS Applications:\r\nNot limited to strictly aluminum-based or copper-based conductors, there are\r\nother advanced technologies that support the specific goals of CABLE while\r\nbringing benefit to EDS. Proposals will be considered in the following areas.\r\nAdherence to standards and demonstrated grid-scale viability is essential to\r\nmaintaining a strong application.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAluminum/ Copper composite materials\r\n\r\n·        \r\nOther conductor materials or cable designs that align with CABLE\r\ngoals\r\n\r\n·        \r\nGrid-viable projects that support advanced materials integration\r\ninto transmission infrastructure.

Non-metallic\r\nHeat Exchangers (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for next-generation non-metallic heat exchanger\r\nsystems to improve the energy efficiency of heat pumps and air conditioners\r\nover a broad range of operating conditions for building and industrial\r\napplications that leverage CABLE non-metallic materials with enhanced thermal\r\nconductivity.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCurrent state-of-the art,\r\nair-to-refrigerant heat exchangers typically use copper-tube, aluminum-fin\r\nconstruction, with internal enhancement in the tubes and lances or louvers in\r\nthe fins to promote heat transfer.  Metal derived heat exchanger designs are\r\ntoday’s state-of-the art (SOA) heat exchangers, like microchannel heat\r\nexchangers (MCHX). \r\n\r\nPrior R&D investment by DOE\r\nhave looked at, high performance compact heat exchanger, low charge heat\r\nexchanger designs and rotating designs. The development of polymer or non-metal\r\nheat exchange designs are ideal due to their light weight, manufacturing\r\npotential, wide range of geometric design possibilities, corrosion resistance,\r\nand potential to be low cost. Polymer heat exchangers have not taken off as a\r\npracticable solution due to their relatively low thermal conductivity. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsidering the potential\r\nadvantages non-metallic enhanced conductivity materials afford, this subtopic\r\nseeks new designs for heat exchangers suitable for condensers or evaporators in\r\nair conditioners or heating-only heat pumps, as well as heat exchangers\r\nsuitable for both condensing and evaporating for reversible heat pumps.  All\r\nsolutions must have the potential to enable the market acceptance at scale.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGiven the wide range of technology\r\nsuitable for this subtopic, specific application targets are not defined but\r\nproposed innovations must exceed the state-of-the-art performance\r\nsignificantly.

Ice-storage\r\nand Other Thermal Storage-related Systems (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor high performance (efficient and cost-effective) ice-based thermal storage\r\ntechnologies that leverage CABLE enhanced thermal conductivity materials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe water-ice phase change is\r\nattractive for thermal (cold) energy storage because of its large heat of fusion\r\nresulting in high energy density, low cost, near constant storage temperature\r\n(melt temperature) along with minimal environmental impact.  Applications of\r\nice storage include heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and\r\nrefrigeration technologies, including direct expansion and chilled water, load\r\nbalancing, integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring ice storage charging, a\r\nheat transfer fluid at a lower temperature is used to form ice, and during\r\ndischarging, the process is reversed and ice melts into water and the heat\r\ntransfer fluid is cooled down.  The challenge with ice storage is that ice is a\r\nrelatively poor thermal conductor. Thus, as ice is formed it becomes\r\nkinetically prohibitive to form more ice, limiting the total amount of stored\r\nenergy over a fixed period.  Typically, extensive piping is used to increase\r\nthe total energy stored.  Moreover, this approach leads to increased overall\r\nfootprint and cost of the storage systems often making them marginally- or non-economical. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic therefore will\r\nsupport proposals that look to overcome these issues associated with thermal\r\nenergy storage through new materials and thermal control approaches.  This\r\nsubtopic is interested in both passive and active approaches such as novel\r\nmaterials, high conductivity reinforcements, tunable conductivity, and use of\r\nexternal stimuli to control thermal conductivity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKey metrics for such technologies\r\nare shown in the table below.

Electric\r\nSystems—Generators and Motors (CABLE)      \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for more affordable, efficient direct current (DC),\r\nsingle-phase and three-phase alternating current (AC) electric\r\nmotors/generators that leverage innovations in CABLE materials. Generator/motor\r\nsystems with integrated power conversion system innovations that improve\r\noverall system performance are also of interest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the U.S. used 37.1\r\nquadrillion Btu (quads) of primary energy to generate electricity for the grid\r\nand consumed approximately 13.75 quads of site electricity in 2018 [1, 2]. Of\r\nthis, nearly 98 percent of the electricity came from mechanical generators\r\n[3].  On the demand side, electric motors consumed more 50 percent of all\r\nelectrical energy in the US and more than 85 percent of industrial electrical\r\nenergy. [4] Both generators and motors rely on electrically conductive\r\nmaterials.  Generators convert mechanical power into electrical power while\r\nmotors convert electrical power into mechanical power. Improving the performance\r\nof motors and generators is critical to the U.S. energy system. Advances in\r\nCABLE materials provide significant opportunity to increase the power density\r\nof motor and generator technologies while reducing energy losses, increasing\r\nperformance, and providing for better and/or lower complexity thermal\r\nmanagement of these systems. Proposals are sought in the following two areas of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nElectrical generator technologies have been used in hydropower\r\nfor more than a century in power generation applications. Recent growth in the\r\nrenewable energy sector has highlighted the need for more flexible, efficient,\r\nand reliable technologies—particularly in distributed applications where\r\ncontinued innovation is needed to lower costs. Conventional grid connected generators\r\nare heavy, have a large form factor, and distributed systems must survive in\r\nharsh or extreme conditions, and often in remote and difficult to access\r\nlocations (offshore wind and marine energy for example). This results in higher\r\ntransportation and installation, operations, and maintenance (IO&M) costs\r\nand the need for complex thermal management systems – estimates suggest that\r\noperations and maintenance (O&M) costs make up 20%-30% of the lifecycle\r\ncosts for offshore wind [2]. Advanced materials hold promise to meaningfully\r\nlower the cost of energy to end users by lowering the cost of O&M and\r\nthrough improvements to efficiency and capital costs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nMotor-driven components used in heating, ventilation, and air\r\nconditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration are the highest energy consumers in the\r\nbuildings sectors. Most of the residential and commercial equipment types\r\ncovered in the residential and commercial sectors are covered by DOE energy\r\nconservation standards and industry standards such as ASHRAE 90.1. These\r\nstandards continue to push manufacturers to consider both more efficient motors\r\nand variable-speed technologies, among other product design improvements, to\r\nmeet more stringent minimum efficiency requirements. However, research efforts\r\nand incentives outside of DOE regulation would enable further reductions in\r\nmotor-driven system energy consumption in the residential and commercial\r\nsectors. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInnovations in CABLE materials\r\nhave great potential to increase the performance (including power density and\r\nreliability) of both motor and generator systems.

These electrical conductors include the metal contacts on the\r\nsolar cell, wiring, and connectors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for\r\nthe application of new conductive materials and related technologies to advance\r\nthe state of the art in two areas: cell and module metal contacts and\r\ninterconnects and PV system electrical connections.  Applicants must clearly\r\nindicate which of the two areas of interest being proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Cell and module metal contacts\r\nand interconnects\r\n\r\nThere are strict requirements for making\r\nhigh-performance contacts and interconnects. Improvements in contacts are\r\nneeded to increase the conductivity and durability while reducing their total\r\ncost of processing and raising the overall module performance. Applying the\r\ncontact to the solar cell must: (1) not introduce too many recombination\r\ncenters at the interface of the metal and the absorber material, because it\r\nwould reduce the power output, (2) form an energetically favorable path at the\r\ninterface for charges to move from the absorber material to the metal, and (3)\r\nbe conductive enough to carry charges out of the cell without appreciable loss\r\ndue to series resistance or shadowing. These technical requirements must all be\r\nmet while maintaining low cost, reliability, durability over decades, and\r\ncompatibility with the packaging materials and existing manufacturing\r\nprocesses. Meeting these requirements through the application of new materials\r\nhas the potential to meet these requirements. A third of cell fabrication costs\r\nare attributed to metal contacts. Metal contact and interconnect costs are\r\nbetween 10% and 30% of the total module cost owing to the materials and\r\nprocessing costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this area should\r\npropose the development of new cell and module metallization materials and processes.\r\nApplicants are expected to include objectives and milestones targeting a\r\nrecombination current density (Jo) of the metallization contact of less than 10\r\nfA/cm2, contact shading < 3% of active area, a cell fill factor of greater\r\nthan 80%, and improved durability under chemical, thermal, and mechanical\r\nstresses that a module will experience in the field. The total cost for the\r\nmetal contact materials and manufacturing step should be less than half of\r\ncurrent costs, and projects must show that final mini-module test structures\r\nhave better energy yield than a comparable baseline that uses state-of-the-art\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. PV system electrical connections\r\n\r\nInnovations in wire management and\r\ncable attachment present an opportunity to extend system durability well beyond\r\nthe traditional 25-30-year PV plant life. EERE’s goal is to extend the\r\noperational life of PV systems to 50 years. Critical interfaces and conductors\r\nmust be capable of maintaining low-resistance electrical pathways despite\r\nthermal cycling, moisture ingress, mechanical loading, and other environmental\r\nchallenges. At the utility scale, designs that increase the mechanical\r\nrobustness of cabling interfaces, such as the attachment point to a tracker or\r\ndesigns that increase the installation speed of a PV plant, may result in lower\r\nlevelized cost of electricity (LCOE) through lower operation and maintenance\r\n(O&M) and capital expenditures (CapEx) costs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications in this area must\r\ndemonstrate improved durability under accelerated life testing commensurate\r\nwith a 50-year system lifetime with equivalent or improved electrical\r\nconductivity. Novel solutions for integrated wire management, such as cabling\r\nembedded in module framing or racking, may improve resistance to animal and\r\nenvironmental damage, thus avoiding expensive repair and replacement costs over\r\nthe life of the system. The goal of this subtopic is to double the durability\r\nof PV systems or residential cabling and cabling attachments while reducing\r\nboth installation time and bill-of-materials cost by 10%. Applicants must\r\ndemonstrate the improvement by relevant component-level testing, using\r\nstate-of-the-art, commercially available products for comparison. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Topic 16 (SETO)\r\nfor other opportunities related to solar energy technologies other than module\r\nand system electrical connections.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ng.      Geothermal:\r\nDirect Use and Electricity Generation Applications (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThe Geothermal Technologies Office\r\n(GTO) collaborates with the geothermal community with the goal of increasing\r\ngeothermal electricity generation and the use of geothermal heat pumps and\r\ndistrict heating by 2050 [1]. This subtopic solicits innovative research and\r\ndevelopment projects using enhanced conductivity materials or technologies in\r\nsubsurface reservoir/wellbore environments for geothermal direct use\r\napplications and/or at electricity-producing geothermal power plants in order\r\nto reduce the levelized cost of heat or electricity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor both direct use and power\r\nplants, GTO is seeking applications using enhanced conductivity materials to\r\nimprove the thermal conductivity and heat transferred from the subsurface\r\nenvironment to the surface.  For electricity-producing geothermal power\r\nplants, proposed materials and technologies must be designed for use in harsh\r\ndownhole environments with elevated temperatures of greater than 225°C. \r\nFor direct use applications, temperatures are typically lower than for\r\nelectricity-producing power plants, but many similar technical challenges\r\nexist.  Applications may include, but are not limited to the following: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved wellbore materials such as high-conductivity cement or\r\ngrout; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nWorking fluids that optimize the net energy capture; and/or\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproving the thermal conductivity within the geothermal\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicants must include\r\nperformance targets for the proposed technology that can be benchmarked to\r\ncomparable state-of-the art applications.  Innovation into surfaced-based\r\nimprovements, superconductive materials, or other types of standard operational\r\nefficiency improvements will be deemed non-responsive.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Topic 1213 (GTO)\r\nfor other opportunities related to geothermal energy technologies other than\r\nsubsurface applications of enhanced conductivity materials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: William\r\nVandermeer, Geothermal Technologies Office, William.Vandermeer@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nh.      Enhanced\r\nConductivity EV Charging Cables and Couplers (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic is soliciting\r\nproposals for the application of CABLE materials for new designs for wires and\r\ncharging couplers for use in the recharging of electric vehicles. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs more and more vehicles are\r\nelectrified, the energy losses in the charging couplers used to recharge these\r\nvehicles will continue to grow especially as ever faster charging powers are\r\nconsidered [1]. Improvements in the conductive materials used in the wire and\r\ncontacts in the SAE J1772 DC charging coupler and cable, that operate at up to\r\n400A and 1000V, are sought to reduce these energy losses.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed improved material and\r\ncoupler designs must consider all requirements for electric vehicle couplers\r\nincluding thermal, electrical, and other safety standards (e.g., UL 2202, UL\r\n2251, ISO 17409, IEC 62196, IEC 60309) while not decreasing cable flexibility\r\nor increasing the weight from existing cable designs. The lifetime energy loss\r\nreductions from the proposed material and coupler design should be calculated\r\nfor the entire cable system from the Electrical Vehicle Supply Equipment to the\r\ninlet of the vehicle for the lifetime of the cable. The impact of corrosion,\r\nfatigue, thermal degradation, and other impacts to the material lifetime should\r\nalso be considered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Topic 17 (VTO) for\r\nother opportunities related to vehicle technologies. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Lee Slezak,\r\nVehicle Technologies Office, Lee.Slezak@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nFor more information on the DOE offices that comprise CABLE see the\r\nfollowing websites: Office of Electricity (OE) (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity);\r\nand those for seven Offices within DOE’s Office of Efficiency and Renewable\r\nEnergy (EERE): Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) (http://energy.gov/eere/amo), Building\r\nTechnologies Office (BTO) (http://energy.gov/eere/buildings),\r\nSolar Energy Technologies Office (https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-energy-technologies-office), \r\nthe Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) (https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal),\r\nthe Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) (https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/vehicle-technologies-office);\r\nthe Wind Energy Technologies Office Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) (https://energy.gov/eere/wind) and the\r\nWater Power Technologies Office (WPTO) (http://energy.gov/eere/water/water-power-program).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). “Annual Energy Review\r\n(AER) 2020.” https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). “U.S. EIA Annual Energy\r\nOutlook (AEO) 2020.” https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.     \r\nRoberts, D. “The Key to Tackling Climate Change: Electrify Everything.”\r\nVox, Oct 27, 2017, https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.     \r\nCao, M., Xiong, D.B., Yang, L., Li, S., Xie, Y., Guo, Q., Li, Z., Adams,\r\nH., Gu, J., Fan, T., Zhang, X., and Zhang, D. “Ultrahigh Electrical\r\nConductivity of Graphene Embedded in Metals.” Adv.

This subtopic seeks proposals to commercialize the innovation in CABLE\r\nmaterials manufacturing presented in the May 2020 patent and related patent\r\napplications from Argonne National Laboratory listed below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe patent solves one of the\r\ntechnical problems for manufacturing high purity, oxygen-free metal-carbon\r\ncomposites with an electric current.

The method described herein also can be\r\napplied to produce multi-element-carbon composites within a metal or alloy\r\nmatrix, including high melting temperature materials such as ceramic particles\r\nor prefabricated nano- or micro-structures, such as carbon nanotubes or\r\ngraphene compounds. The covetic reaction between metal and carbon takes place\r\nunder the influence of flowing electrons through the melted metal-carbon\r\nprecursor. This process posited to create strong bonding between nanocarbon\r\nstructure and the metal elements in the melt.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe 2019 patent application is for\r\nthe initial version of the method to make covetic metal-nanostructured carbon\r\ncomposites or compositions. The method comprises the introduction of carbon\r\ninto a molten metal in a heated reactor under low oxygen partial pressure, and\r\nthe passing of an electric current through the molten metal. After heating the\r\ncovetic material is recovered from the reactor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe 2020 patent application is for\r\na method for preparing a covetic, nanocarbon-infused, metal composite material\r\nby heating a stirring molten mixture of a conducting metal (e.g., Cu, Al, Ag,\r\nAu, Fe, Ni, Pt, Sn, Pb, Zn, Si) and carbon (e.g., graphite) at a temperature\r\nsufficient to maintain the mixture in the molten state in a reactor vessel,\r\nwhile passing an electric current through the molten mixture via at least two\r\nspaced electrodes submerged or partially submerged in the molten metal. Each of\r\nthe electrodes has an electrical conductivity that is at least about 50 percent\r\nof the electrical conductivity of the molten mixture at the temperature of the\r\nmolten mixture. Preferably, the conductivity of the electrodes is equal to or\r\ngreater than the conductivity of the molten mixture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Topic 9 (AMO) for\r\nother opportunities related to Advanced Manufacturing technologies. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPatent Status: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nU.S. Patent No. 10,662,509 B2, “Metal-carbon composition and\r\ncomposite manufacturing method” Issued May 26, 2020. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nU.S. Patent Application No. US 2019/0381563 A1 “Method for making\r\nmetal-nanostructured carbon composite\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nU.S. Patent Application No. US 2020/0176573 A1 “Electrodes for\r\nmaking nanocarbon - infused metals and alloys”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: John Ahn, jahn@anl.gov, Argonne National Laboratory and\r\nTina Kaarsberg, Advanced Manufacturing Office, Tina.Kaarsberg@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

"subtopic_description": "b.      Electricity\r\nDelivery System Applications (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits innovative\r\nresearch and development (R&D) proposals that can enable breakthrough\r\napplications to better secure the national grid and make efficiency and\r\naffordability improvements to electricity delivery system (EDS) infrastructure.\r\nThis subtopic is being jointly supported by the Office of Electricity and the\r\nEERE Advanced Manufacturing Office. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe U.S. electricity delivery\r\nsystem is currently undergoing a transformation as the importance of grid\r\nreliability and resilience is realized in the face of evolving threats\r\n(including cyber-attacks and extreme weather), and state and local policies\r\nincrease penetration of renewable energy and distributed energy resources\r\n(DERs). To ensure reliable and secure electricity delivery in the future grid\r\nthrough these changes, technological advancements in transmission &\r\ndistribution (T&D) infrastructure must be made [1]. Specifically,\r\nimprovements are required in T&D infrastructure, and at their most\r\nfundamental, the material that transports power: conductors, and their\r\napplication in transmission cables.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals to\r\nintegrate affordable high-performance conductors into transmission and\r\ndistribution applications to provide numerous benefits to EDS and other\r\npower-carrying applications (including overhead, underground and underwater\r\ncables). Lines or cables with significantly improved conductivity yield\r\ntransmission benefits including minimized losses, increased strength, reduced\r\nsag and improved carrying capacity, all of which improve performance and\r\noperations. Improved-performance conductors promise immense benefits to all\r\nsystem stakeholders [2]. To the grid operator, the benefits from installing\r\nadvanced lines and cables include increased grid reliability and resilience. To\r\nthe customer, use of such lines and cables results in significant cost savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this subtopic\r\nis to design a proof-of-concept conductor for medium- to long- distance\r\ntransmission lines and cables. In performing this design research, both desired\r\nproperties and design specifications must be considered. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesired properties of conductors\r\nfor EDS applications include [3]:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLow resistance to minimize electricity loss.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved mechanical strength for maximized reliability.\r\n\r\no  \r\nImproved tensile strength.\r\n\r\no  \r\nImproved mechanical bend fatigue performance.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved thermal conductivity.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved melting points to maintain high operational strength.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nHigh ductility for mechanical flexibility.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEarth-abundant content for minimized cost.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nRecyclable and safe material end-of-life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaximizing one or several of these\r\nproperties in the proposed conductor design is a priority of this subtopic. In\r\naddition, proposals to this subtopic must explain how they support OE’s goals\r\nfor innovative transmission reliability, resilient distribution systems, energy\r\nstorage, and advanced grid components.  Proposals are encouraged to draw upon\r\nAMO-sponsored innovations in advanced material manufacturing, particularly for\r\nhigh performance conductors. Advanced manufacturing approaches such as additive\r\nmanufacturing and roll-to-roll are encouraged where appropriate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUse of a breakthrough in one\r\nproperty must be complemented by maintaining the other properties above minimum\r\naccepted values, with minimum standards described in each area of interest\r\nbelow. This is to balance a “breakthrough, leapfrog” improvement with minimums\r\nthat support applicability and future commercialization. Expected improvements\r\nin metrics and how the improvements compare to the current state of the art\r\nmust be clearly stated in proposals in response to this subtopic. Designs\r\nshould maximize economic performance, demonstrate financial viability, and\r\nestablish a credible pathway to commercialization. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA related consideration is meeting\r\nexternal design parameters. Rural utilities and co-operatives generally rely on\r\nUSDA Rural Utility Service (RUS) specifications (and minimum accepted values)\r\nfor designing and implementing electric infrastructure in their jurisdiction.\r\nDesigning conductors that may be used in these areas removes one barrier from\r\nfuture commercialization potential. Properties of interest in these standards\r\nare more practical for the electric delivery application and include:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nOperating voltage\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLine current\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConductor Size\r\n\r\n·        \r\nMax operating temperature\r\n\r\n·        \r\nLine voltage drop\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPower losses\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe specific standards may be\r\nfound at: https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/UEP_Bulletin_1724E-200.pdf\r\n[4]. The linked standards detail aboveground cables specifically, but RUS also\r\npublishes standards for other applications, including underground cables.\r\nFollowing federal standards in designing these conductors may benefit future\r\ncommercialization opportunities and will make the project more appealing to a\r\nwider market. While it is not strictly required to meet any specific set of RUS\r\nstandards, or every single standard in this research, keeping them in mind\r\nwhile designing an advanced conductor proof-of-concept will be favorably viewed\r\nby reviewers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest for this topic\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n1.  Aluminum-Based Conductors:\r\nAluminum is primarily used for overhead transmission lines, as it provides\r\nhigh-conductivity and light-weight benefits for low cost. The most common\r\naluminum-based conductors are aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR), but\r\nother on-the-market options include ACCC, ACCR, and ACSS. As a material,\r\naluminum has potential for overhead lines, and advanced manufacturing methods\r\nmay yield unique advancements for aluminum-based conductors [5]. Table 1\r\ndescribes desired minimum values for several properties of the proof-of-concept\r\naluminum-based conductor. Due to the variable nature of properties of\r\ndifferently sized conductors, precise values may change depending on size and\r\nampacity chosen of the conductor design. As stated earlier, these thresholds\r\nare approximate guidelines for property thresholds to maximize\r\ncommercialization potential in the future; it is expected that the design meets\r\nCABLE goals with an affordable, breakthrough, and leapfrog design.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  Property\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Desired Threshold\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Notes\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Electrical conductivity\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  > 62% IACS\r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Mechanical strength\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Comparable to or stronger than that of on-the-market ACSR\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Precise value may change depending on line rating\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Resistance\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  < 0.2 Ω/1000ft\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  DC at 20°C\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Ductility\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Comparable to or stronger than that of on-the-market ACSR\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Precise value may change depending on line rating\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Cost \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Should not exceed $2/foot finished product\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  May be substantially lower depending on line rating and\r\n  manufacturing methods\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Copper-Based Conductors:\r\nCopper-based conductors benefit from high conductivity and high strength but\r\nsuffer from higher weight and costs. For medium- to long- distance\r\ntransmission, these properties may make copper apt for underground or underwater\r\napplications, because the higher conductivity and strength increase reliability\r\nand efficiency. Aluminum-based conductors are by far the most common conductors\r\nfor transmission applications, and thus there are fewer preferred requirements\r\nfor a copper-based conductor. The proposed design should achieve over 100% IACS\r\nand must display viable application for undersea or underground cabling. Of\r\nutmost importance are minimizing cost while maximizing strength and\r\nconductivity. Discussing demonstrated viability for transmission application\r\nthat may lead to future commercialization will help in the proposal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Other EDS Applications:\r\nNot limited to strictly aluminum-based or copper-based conductors, there are\r\nother advanced technologies that support the specific goals of CABLE while\r\nbringing benefit to EDS. Proposals will be considered in the following areas.\r\nAdherence to standards and demonstrated grid-scale viability is essential to\r\nmaintaining a strong application.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAluminum/ Copper composite materials\r\n\r\n·        \r\nOther conductor materials or cable designs that align with CABLE\r\ngoals\r\n\r\n·        \r\nGrid-viable projects that support advanced materials integration\r\ninto transmission infrastructure. This may include: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nGrid resilience and reliability innovations\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAdvanced insulating materials for high-voltage application\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConductor coatings for harsh conditions\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the Grid\r\nModernization crosscut, emphasizing advancements for future grid architecture\r\nand technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Benjamin\r\nShrager, Office of Electricity, Benjamin.shrager@hq.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

Ice-storage\r\nand Other Thermal Storage-related Systems (CABLE)\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor high performance (efficient and cost-effective) ice-based thermal storage\r\ntechnologies that leverage CABLE enhanced thermal conductivity materials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe water-ice phase change is\r\nattractive for thermal (cold) energy storage because of its large heat of fusion\r\nresulting in high energy density, low cost, near constant storage temperature\r\n(melt temperature) along with minimal environmental impact.

"subtopic_description": "e.      Electric\r\nSystems—Generators and Motors (CABLE)      \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for more affordable, efficient direct current (DC),\r\nsingle-phase and three-phase alternating current (AC) electric\r\nmotors/generators that leverage innovations in CABLE materials. Generator/motor\r\nsystems with integrated power conversion system innovations that improve\r\noverall system performance are also of interest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the U.S. used 37.1\r\nquadrillion Btu (quads) of primary energy to generate electricity for the grid\r\nand consumed approximately 13.75 quads of site electricity in 2018 [1, 2]. Of\r\nthis, nearly 98 percent of the electricity came from mechanical generators\r\n[3].  On the demand side, electric motors consumed more 50 percent of all\r\nelectrical energy in the US and more than 85 percent of industrial electrical\r\nenergy. [4] Both generators and motors rely on electrically conductive\r\nmaterials.  Generators convert mechanical power into electrical power while\r\nmotors convert electrical power into mechanical power. Improving the performance\r\nof motors and generators is critical to the U.S. energy system. Advances in\r\nCABLE materials provide significant opportunity to increase the power density\r\nof motor and generator technologies while reducing energy losses, increasing\r\nperformance, and providing for better and/or lower complexity thermal\r\nmanagement of these systems. Proposals are sought in the following two areas of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nElectrical generator technologies have been used in hydropower\r\nfor more than a century in power generation applications. Recent growth in the\r\nrenewable energy sector has highlighted the need for more flexible, efficient,\r\nand reliable technologies—particularly in distributed applications where\r\ncontinued innovation is needed to lower costs. Conventional grid connected generators\r\nare heavy, have a large form factor, and distributed systems must survive in\r\nharsh or extreme conditions, and often in remote and difficult to access\r\nlocations (offshore wind and marine energy for example). This results in higher\r\ntransportation and installation, operations, and maintenance (IO&M) costs\r\nand the need for complex thermal management systems – estimates suggest that\r\noperations and maintenance (O&M) costs make up 20%-30% of the lifecycle\r\ncosts for offshore wind [2]. Advanced materials hold promise to meaningfully\r\nlower the cost of energy to end users by lowering the cost of O&M and\r\nthrough improvements to efficiency and capital costs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nMotor-driven components used in heating, ventilation, and air\r\nconditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration are the highest energy consumers in the\r\nbuildings sectors. Most of the residential and commercial equipment types\r\ncovered in the residential and commercial sectors are covered by DOE energy\r\nconservation standards and industry standards such as ASHRAE 90.1. These\r\nstandards continue to push manufacturers to consider both more efficient motors\r\nand variable-speed technologies, among other product design improvements, to\r\nmeet more stringent minimum efficiency requirements. However, research efforts\r\nand incentives outside of DOE regulation would enable further reductions in\r\nmotor-driven system energy consumption in the residential and commercial\r\nsectors. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInnovations in CABLE materials\r\nhave great potential to increase the performance (including power density and\r\nreliability) of both motor and generator systems.

These electrical conductors include the metal contacts on the\r\nsolar cell, wiring, and connectors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for\r\nthe application of new conductive materials and related technologies to advance\r\nthe state of the art in two areas: cell and module metal contacts and\r\ninterconnects and PV system electrical connections.  Applicants must clearly\r\nindicate which of the two areas of interest being proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Cell and module metal contacts\r\nand interconnects\r\n\r\nThere are strict requirements for making\r\nhigh-performance contacts and interconnects. Improvements in contacts are\r\nneeded to increase the conductivity and durability while reducing their total\r\ncost of processing and raising the overall module performance. Applying the\r\ncontact to the solar cell must: (1) not introduce too many recombination\r\ncenters at the interface of the metal and the absorber material, because it\r\nwould reduce the power output, (2) form an energetically favorable path at the\r\ninterface for charges to move from the absorber material to the metal, and (3)\r\nbe conductive enough to carry charges out of the cell without appreciable loss\r\ndue to series resistance or shadowing. These technical requirements must all be\r\nmet while maintaining low cost, reliability, durability over decades, and\r\ncompatibility with the packaging materials and existing manufacturing\r\nprocesses. Meeting these requirements through the application of new materials\r\nhas the potential to meet these requirements. A third of cell fabrication costs\r\nare attributed to metal contacts. Metal contact and interconnect costs are\r\nbetween 10% and 30% of the total module cost owing to the materials and\r\nprocessing costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this area should\r\npropose the development of new cell and module metallization materials and processes.\r\nApplicants are expected to include objectives and milestones targeting a\r\nrecombination current density (Jo) of the metallization contact of less than 10\r\nfA/cm2, contact shading < 3% of active area, a cell fill factor of greater\r\nthan 80%, and improved durability under chemical, thermal, and mechanical\r\nstresses that a module will experience in the field. The total cost for the\r\nmetal contact materials and manufacturing step should be less than half of\r\ncurrent costs, and projects must show that final mini-module test structures\r\nhave better energy yield than a comparable baseline that uses state-of-the-art\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. PV system electrical connections\r\n\r\nInnovations in wire management and\r\ncable attachment present an opportunity to extend system durability well beyond\r\nthe traditional 25-30-year PV plant life. EERE’s goal is to extend the\r\noperational life of PV systems to 50 years. Critical interfaces and conductors\r\nmust be capable of maintaining low-resistance electrical pathways despite\r\nthermal cycling, moisture ingress, mechanical loading, and other environmental\r\nchallenges. At the utility scale, designs that increase the mechanical\r\nrobustness of cabling interfaces, such as the attachment point to a tracker or\r\ndesigns that increase the installation speed of a PV plant, may result in lower\r\nlevelized cost of electricity (LCOE) through lower operation and maintenance\r\n(O&M) and capital expenditures (CapEx) costs. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications in this area must\r\ndemonstrate improved durability under accelerated life testing commensurate\r\nwith a 50-year system lifetime with equivalent or improved electrical\r\nconductivity. Novel solutions for integrated wire management, such as cabling\r\nembedded in module framing or racking, may improve resistance to animal and\r\nenvironmental damage, thus avoiding expensive repair and replacement costs over\r\nthe life of the system. The goal of this subtopic is to double the durability\r\nof PV systems or residential cabling and cabling attachments while reducing\r\nboth installation time and bill-of-materials cost by 10%. Applicants must\r\ndemonstrate the improvement by relevant component-level testing, using\r\nstate-of-the-art, commercially available products for comparison. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Topic 16 (SETO)\r\nfor other opportunities related to solar energy technologies other than module\r\nand system electrical connections.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n ",

This Initiative is\r\naimed at developing and deploying more cost effective long-term strategies and\r\ntechnologies to monitor closure sites (including soil, groundwater and surface\r\nwater) with multiple contaminants (organics, metals and radionuclides) to\r\nverify integrated long-term cleanup performance. Long-term monitoring and\r\nmaintenance will soon become one of the largest projected cost centers in the\r\noverall lifecycle of both Environmental Management; moreover, costs associated\r\nwith the implemented systems will extend into future Legacy Management. Much of\r\nthe cost is associated with frequent analyses of contaminants in a large number\r\nof monitoring wells. Such measurements are often expensive and the resulting\r\ndatasets are inefficient and inadequate for meeting long term monitoring\r\nobjectives. The approach to long-term monitoring is a systems based approach\r\nwhich includes 4 broad themes: spatially integrated monitoring tools, onsite\r\nand field monitoring tools & sensor, engineered diagnostic components, and\r\nintegrated risk management & decision support tools.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe propose to solicit the best concepts from industry on the\r\nfollowing theme:\r\n\r\nA. Real-time Sampling & Analysis of Tank Waste with\r\nRemote or On-pipe Monitoring\r\n\r\nB. Non-Intrusive Mercury Detection and Measurement\r\n\r\nC. Other\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Real-time\r\nSampling & Analysis of Tank Waste with Remote or On-pipe Monitoring\r\n\r\nIntroduction: The chemical,\r\nradiological, and physical properties of nuclear and hazardous chemical tank\r\nwaste need to be characterized to meet regulatory requirements and to provide\r\ninformation needed to support decisions and actions related to tank corrosion\r\ncontrol (safety basis), industrial hygiene (e.g., worker safety/vapors),\r\nretrieval planning (technology selection), waste compatibility assessments for\r\nfeed staging, waste treatment plant waste acceptance, and tank closure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChallenge: The current approach to obtaining chemical,\r\nradiological, and physical properties of tank waste includes obtaining physical\r\ngrab/core samples and having them analyzed by an analytical laboratory. The\r\nsampling tool that is selected to obtain physical samples typically includes a\r\ncollection of available sampler technology that includes finger-trap samplers,\r\nclamshell samplers, drag samplers, auger samplers, core samplers, etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nData quality objectives (DQOs) for regulator-driven tank waste\r\ncharacterization are challenging to meet with physical sampling because: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nphysical samples are often not representative of the tank volume\r\nthat was sampled;\r\n\r\n·        \r\na long backlog in sample collection and laboratory analysis can\r\nexist that slows turn-around times; and \r\n\r\n·        \r\nthe cost to open a tank and perform sample collection and\r\ntransport can be very high.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNeed: Innovative sample analysis instrumentation is needed that\r\ncan be deployed in waste tanks or in/on waste transfer slurry lines to perform\r\nin-situ/real-time analysis of Hanford waste. For example, instrumentation that\r\ncan:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nperform density, viscosity and rheology measurements in pipes; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nperform particle size and concentration measurements in pipes;  \r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify interstitial liquid levels in tanks;\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify halides such as fluoride, chloride and iodine\r\nin tanks/pipes;\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify total organic carbon in tanks/pipes; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, mercury, copper\r\nlead, chromium, cyanide, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, vanadium,\r\nzinc and other constituents.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPublic\r\nBenefit: Adding real-time, in-situ\r\nsampling and analysis of hazardous waste in tanks and pipes with remote on-pipe\r\nor in-tank monitoring instrumentation will decrease worker exposure to\r\ntank waste hazards, such as harmful vapors, by decreasing the number of\r\nphysical samples that must be taken collected from waste tanks/pipes,\r\ntransported to an analytical laboratory, and handled during sample analysis.\r\nReal-time, in-situ sampling and analysis within tank farms is also expected to\r\nsupport more efficient tank farm and waste treatment/processing facility\r\noperations by reducing analysis time from weeks/months to seconds/minutes. More\r\nefficient operations will lead to closure of the ageing waste tank (and pipe)\r\ninfrastructure as early as possible, which is in the best interest of the\r\nenvironment’s and public’s health and safety.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Latrincy\r\nBates, Latrincy.Bates@em.doe.gov or\r\nGrover Chamberlain, grover.chamberlain@em.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Non-Intrusive\r\nMercury Detection and Measurement\r\n\r\nElemental mercury was extensively\r\nused at the Y-12 National Security Complex during the Cold War effort.  Losses\r\nof significant amounts of mercury to building piping, equipment, and actual\r\nbuilding structures (walls and floors – steel, concrete, drywall, Transit\r\n[asbestos boards and piping], clay tiles, etc.) occurred.  Four former-use\r\nlarge industrial production facilities and their ancillary facilities are\r\ncontaminated or may be contaminated with elemental and other mercury species to\r\ndiffering concentrations.  These facilities are up to four floors in height,\r\nwith footprints of several hundred thousand square feet each, and miles of\r\npiping both inside and outside the facilities, some with holdup and/or decaying\r\nconditions present.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic is focused on identifying\r\ntechnologies that can be used to non-intrusively detect elemental mercury in\r\nbuilding materials, piping, equipment, and waste containers that will\r\nfacilitate its segregation and removal.  The technologies should be capable of\r\ndetecting mercury in structures, piping, and equipment constructed of various\r\nmaterials/metals of varying thicknesses in the presence of solid residue\r\nmaterials.  Detection equipment must be portable and capable of measuring in\r\nall orientations.  Real-time analysis and display are preferable, with\r\nquantification of sufficient accuracy for use in meeting waste acceptance\r\ncriteria based on meeting land disposal restrictions for mercury.

Real-time\r\nSampling & Analysis of Tank Waste with Remote or On-pipe Monitoring\r\n\r\nIntroduction: The chemical,\r\nradiological, and physical properties of nuclear and hazardous chemical tank\r\nwaste need to be characterized to meet regulatory requirements and to provide\r\ninformation needed to support decisions and actions related to tank corrosion\r\ncontrol (safety basis), industrial hygiene (e.g., worker safety/vapors),\r\nretrieval planning (technology selection), waste compatibility assessments for\r\nfeed staging, waste treatment plant waste acceptance, and tank closure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChallenge: The current approach to obtaining chemical,\r\nradiological, and physical properties of tank waste includes obtaining physical\r\ngrab/core samples and having them analyzed by an analytical laboratory. The\r\nsampling tool that is selected to obtain physical samples typically includes a\r\ncollection of available sampler technology that includes finger-trap samplers,\r\nclamshell samplers, drag samplers, auger samplers, core samplers, etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nData quality objectives (DQOs) for regulator-driven tank waste\r\ncharacterization are challenging to meet with physical sampling because: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nphysical samples are often not representative of the tank volume\r\nthat was sampled;\r\n\r\n·        \r\na long backlog in sample collection and laboratory analysis can\r\nexist that slows turn-around times; and \r\n\r\n·        \r\nthe cost to open a tank and perform sample collection and\r\ntransport can be very high.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNeed: Innovative sample analysis instrumentation is needed that\r\ncan be deployed in waste tanks or in/on waste transfer slurry lines to perform\r\nin-situ/real-time analysis of Hanford waste. For example, instrumentation that\r\ncan:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nperform density, viscosity and rheology measurements in pipes; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nperform particle size and concentration measurements in pipes;  \r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify interstitial liquid levels in tanks;\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify halides such as fluoride, chloride and iodine\r\nin tanks/pipes;\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify total organic carbon in tanks/pipes; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\ndetect and quantify arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, mercury, copper\r\nlead, chromium, cyanide, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, vanadium,\r\nzinc and other constituents.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPublic\r\nBenefit: Adding real-time, in-situ\r\nsampling and analysis of hazardous waste in tanks and pipes with remote on-pipe\r\nor in-tank monitoring instrumentation will decrease worker exposure to\r\ntank waste hazards, such as harmful vapors, by decreasing the number of\r\nphysical samples that must be taken collected from waste tanks/pipes,\r\ntransported to an analytical laboratory, and handled during sample analysis.\r\nReal-time, in-situ sampling and analysis within tank farms is also expected to\r\nsupport more efficient tank farm and waste treatment/processing facility\r\noperations by reducing analysis time from weeks/months to seconds/minutes. More\r\nefficient operations will lead to closure of the ageing waste tank (and pipe)\r\ninfrastructure as early as possible, which is in the best interest of the\r\nenvironment’s and public’s health and safety.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Latrincy\r\nBates, Latrincy.Bates@em.doe.gov or\r\nGrover Chamberlain, grover.chamberlain@em.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n \r\n",

"subtopic_description": "b.      Non-Intrusive\r\nMercury Detection and Measurement\r\n\r\nElemental mercury was extensively\r\nused at the Y-12 National Security Complex during the Cold War effort.  Losses\r\nof significant amounts of mercury to building piping, equipment, and actual\r\nbuilding structures (walls and floors – steel, concrete, drywall, Transit\r\n[asbestos boards and piping], clay tiles, etc.) occurred.  Four former-use\r\nlarge industrial production facilities and their ancillary facilities are\r\ncontaminated or may be contaminated with elemental and other mercury species to\r\ndiffering concentrations.  These facilities are up to four floors in height,\r\nwith footprints of several hundred thousand square feet each, and miles of\r\npiping both inside and outside the facilities, some with holdup and/or decaying\r\nconditions present.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic is focused on identifying\r\ntechnologies that can be used to non-intrusively detect elemental mercury in\r\nbuilding materials, piping, equipment, and waste containers that will\r\nfacilitate its segregation and removal.  The technologies should be capable of\r\ndetecting mercury in structures, piping, and equipment constructed of various\r\nmaterials/metals of varying thicknesses in the presence of solid residue\r\nmaterials.

Regarding pre-existing wells and boreholes, characterization\r\nof wellbore integrity or borehole conditions is an important task in making the\r\ndecision to move forward with a large-scale carbon storage project. In\r\naddition, knowing the location of all wells in the area of review is critically\r\nimportant in setting up monitoring at a carbon storage site. Deep legacy\r\nwellbores represent a potential leakage pathway for CO2 stored underground and\r\nmay not be identified until found through detection of abnormal fluid movement\r\nduring injection operations. Old wellbores can be difficult to locate because\r\nof incomplete or missing records, location in overgrown or wooded areas, or\r\nwellbore damage or collapse.  Wellbores without metal surface casing cannot be\r\nlocated using electromagnetic sensors.  Reported locations in old well records\r\ncan easily be incorrect by hundreds of feet, especially for very old wells that\r\nwere not formally surveyed. There are also legacy wells for which no records\r\nexist. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce detected, technologies, correlations and workflows are\r\nneeded to assess the condition of the entire wellbore or bore hole.  This may\r\ninclude quantifying uncertainties about wellbore conditions that would relate\r\nto long-term containment of CO2 in the storage complex. Characterization of\r\nlegacy wellbores is more challenging when re-entry is complicated by\r\ndeteriorated conditions of the wellbore. Existing technologies can perform a\r\nreasonable job evaluating the casing-to-cement interface in a new well.\r\nHowever, older wells, especially those that have been through many pressure\r\ncycles, have usually developed annular cracks between the casing and cement\r\nthat makes it much more difficult to evaluate the hydraulic integrity.\r\nFurthermore, cracks may develop between the cement and borehole wall, and\r\nlittle is known about how to evaluate the integrity of the cement-to-rock\r\ninterface. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought for the following subtopic:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nTechnologies for Detection and Characterization of Legacy Wellbores:\r\nCarbon Storage\r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought that\r\ndevelop technologies to (1) detect legacy wellbores that lack a steel surface\r\ncasing or (2) assess the integrity of legacy wells in which conventional\r\nlogging tools cannot provide the needed information.

New sensors, tools, methods or\r\ncombinations thereof, that can characterize the hydraulic integrity of a\r\nwellbore out to the formation face at high resolution or through/around a plug,\r\nno matter the age or condition of the well, are also sought.

These potential benefits, combined with the\r\ncompounding performance benefits from a more efficient cycle on balance of\r\nplant requirements, fuel use, emissions, water use and cost-of-electricity\r\n(COE), are creating broad interest in sCO2 power cycles. The indirect sCO2\r\nrecompression Brayton cycle has the advantage of using a wide range of thermal\r\nheat sources (e.g., nuclear, concentrated solar, fossil, waste heat). This\r\nresults in the power plant design being dependent on the temperature of this\r\nthermal heat source with the overall efficiency usually increasing with\r\ntemperature. System analysis studies by many research organizations including\r\nNETL have projected efficiency improvements of 2 – 6 percentage points when compared\r\nwith Rankine cycles operating at similar process conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought in the following topics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nSupercritical Carbon Dioxide Resistant Coatings for Turbomachinery \r\n\r\nThermal barrier coatings (TBC) and\r\nanti-friction coatings are known to provide benefits for turbomachinery in\r\npower cycles, including higher use temperature, greater erosion resistance,\r\ntoughness, and improved sintering resistance, increased wear-resistance and\r\ncomponent lifetime. However, the use of TBCs and anti-friction coatings is not\r\nas well-investigated for sCO2-based power cycles, where the working fluid is\r\nsupercritical CO2. Applications are being sought for the research and\r\ndevelopment of optimum thermal barrier and anti-friction coatings for\r\nlarge-scale sCO2 Recompression closed Brayton cycle (RCBC) turbomachinery\r\napplications. Applicants should identify and investigate TBC and/or\r\nanti-friction coatings that are sCO2-resistant with appropriate application\r\nmethods for large-scale turbomachinery at conditions relevant to the sCO2 RCBC.\r\nThe high density of the CO2 and small turbine pressure drop creates compact\r\nturbomachinery with unique temperature gradients.  The proposed coating must be\r\ntolerant against delamination, erosion (surface requirement) resistant to corrosive\r\ngas, support thermal gradients / cycling and offer a thermal barrier. Testing\r\nshould be designed to identify optimum coatings. The applicant team should have\r\naccess to an sCO2 testing facility. Applicants should clearly describe the\r\ncoating materials, technology, and expected benefits to turbomachinery for\r\nindirect sCO2 power cycle applications. Applications should also include a\r\ndescription of preliminary results of the proposed coatings showing promising\r\nperformance under sCO2 conditions. Collaboration with an OEM is encouraged. The\r\nproposed materials or coating techniques are preferred to be at a later-stage\r\nin the research and development process so they will be ready for commercial\r\npotential in Phase II.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Richard\r\nDalton, Richard.Dalton@netl.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.     \r\nAdvanced Coolers for Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Base Power Cycles \r\n\r\nA pathway to achieving higher sCO2\r\npower cycle efficiencies can be enabled by operating under\r\ncondensing sCO2 cycle conditions. The pressure drop through the cooler plays a\r\nlarge factor in the sCO2 cycle efficiency. These coolers are typically modular\r\nand to meet the desired heat duty multiple modules are used in a system,\r\ntypically with heat duties ranging from 1 – 3 MWth per module. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are being sought for\r\nthe research and development of such advanced coolers to directly cool and\r\ncondense CO2 while minimizing the pressure drop and associated fan power.\r\nApplicants should focus on the conceptual design of the cooler, integration\r\nwith the sCO2 power cycle, and modeling performance. Controllability of the\r\ncooler to rapidly and accurately achieve the desired outlet temperature must be\r\nconsidered, due to the proximity of this operating point to the CO2 critical\r\npoint and its resulting implications for downstream compressor performance.\r\nCooler module designs resulting in a reduction in metal mass should be\r\nconsidered to enhance controllability and response transients. Applications may\r\nalso include basic experimental work (cooler tubing geometries, heat transfer)\r\nto validate the concept. The applicant must clearly describe how the cooler\r\ntechnology will be integrated into the sCO2 power cycle to improve the cycle\r\nperformance.

However, the use of TBCs and anti-friction coatings is not\r\nas well-investigated for sCO2-based power cycles, where the working fluid is\r\nsupercritical CO2. Applications are being sought for the research and\r\ndevelopment of optimum thermal barrier and anti-friction coatings for\r\nlarge-scale sCO2 Recompression closed Brayton cycle (RCBC) turbomachinery\r\napplications. Applicants should identify and investigate TBC and/or\r\nanti-friction coatings that are sCO2-resistant with appropriate application\r\nmethods for large-scale turbomachinery at conditions relevant to the sCO2 RCBC.\r\nThe high density of the CO2 and small turbine pressure drop creates compact\r\nturbomachinery with unique temperature gradients.  The proposed coating must be\r\ntolerant against delamination, erosion (surface requirement) resistant to corrosive\r\ngas, support thermal gradients / cycling and offer a thermal barrier. Testing\r\nshould be designed to identify optimum coatings. The applicant team should have\r\naccess to an sCO2 testing facility. Applicants should clearly describe the\r\ncoating materials, technology, and expected benefits to turbomachinery for\r\nindirect sCO2 power cycle applications. Applications should also include a\r\ndescription of preliminary results of the proposed coatings showing promising\r\nperformance under sCO2 conditions. Collaboration with an OEM is encouraged. The\r\nproposed materials or coating techniques are preferred to be at a later-stage\r\nin the research and development process so they will be ready for commercial\r\npotential in Phase II.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Richard\r\nDalton, Richard.Dalton@netl.doe.gov",

The pressure drop through the cooler plays a\r\nlarge factor in the sCO2 cycle efficiency. These coolers are typically modular\r\nand to meet the desired heat duty multiple modules are used in a system,\r\ntypically with heat duties ranging from 1 – 3 MWth per module. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are being sought for\r\nthe research and development of such advanced coolers to directly cool and\r\ncondense CO2 while minimizing the pressure drop and associated fan power.\r\nApplicants should focus on the conceptual design of the cooler, integration\r\nwith the sCO2 power cycle, and modeling performance. Controllability of the\r\ncooler to rapidly and accurately achieve the desired outlet temperature must be\r\nconsidered, due to the proximity of this operating point to the CO2 critical\r\npoint and its resulting implications for downstream compressor performance.\r\nCooler module designs resulting in a reduction in metal mass should be\r\nconsidered to enhance controllability and response transients.

A major issue with respect to\r\nREE development in the U.S. is the lack of refining, alloying, and fabricating\r\ncapacity that could process any domestic rare earth production [1]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEfforts conducted under DOE-NETL’s Feasibility of Recovering\r\nRare Earth Elements (REE) program between 2014 and 2020, successfully\r\ndemonstrated the very first step for the utilization of coal and coal-based\r\nresources to produce rare earth elements needed for our commodity and defense\r\nindustries.  This achievement was marked by demonstrating the technical\r\nfeasibility and processing capability to extract and separate REE from domestic\r\ncoal-based resources (i.e., run-of-mine coal, coal refuse (mineral matter that\r\nis removed from coal prior to shipment), clay/sandstone over/under-burden\r\nmaterials, ash (coal combustion residuals), and aqueous effluents such as acid\r\nmine drainage (AMD), and associated solids and precipitates resulting from AMD\r\ntreatment), and recovery of these materials as mixed rare earth oxides or salts\r\n(MREO/MRES) at levels of 96-98% purity (960,000-980,000ppm) in three,\r\nfirst-of-a-kind, domestic, small pilot-scale facilities.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCurrently, under DOE/NETL’s RD&D program,\r\nstate-of-the-art, conventional separation process concepts are being assessed\r\nfor near-future production of 1-3 tonnes/day of high-purity MREO in engineering\r\nprototype facilities.  Conversion of the MREO/MRES into individually separated,\r\nhigh purity REO/RES, and subsequently conversion to metals (MREM/MRES) will be\r\nessential for alloying and/or incorporation of these materials into\r\nintermediate products (i.e., magnets; etc.) or into manufactured end-products\r\n(i.e., wind turbines; fuel cells; etc).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBuilding on the accomplishments achieved in DOE-NETL’s\r\nFeasibility of Recovering Rare Earth Elements program, efforts in 2019 were\r\nadditionally directed to co-production of critical minerals (CM), as cobalt\r\n(Co), manganese (Mn), lithium (Li), and potentially aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn),\r\ngermanium (Ge), and gallium (Ga) from domestic, coal-based, REE-containing\r\nfeedstock materials.  This expansion aligned DOE-NETL’s effort to support\r\nExecutive Order 13817 [2], which lead to changing the name of DOE-NETL’s\r\nprogram in 2020 to Critical Minerals Sustainability.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought in the following subtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nAdvanced Technology Development for Production of Individually\r\nSeparated, High Purity, (ISHP) Rare Earth Oxides/Rare Earth Salts (REO/RES)\r\n\r\nCommercial sources of rare earth\r\nelements include bastnaesite (La, Ce)FCO3, monazite, (Ce, La, Y, Th)PO4, and\r\nxenotime, YPO4.   Processing of these materials to extract and recover REE\r\ntypically begins with physical beneficiation (mineral processing as crushing,\r\ngrinding, density separation, magnetic separation, etc.), and is typically\r\nfollowed by chemical separation (i.e., hydrometallurgy: the technique or\r\nprocess of extracting metals at ordinary temperatures by leaching ores with\r\nliquid solvents), leading to the production of a mixed rare earth concentrate. \r\nSeparation of the individual rare earths from each other was considered to be\r\ndifficult, due to similar physical and chemical properties of the elements.  Ion-exchange\r\nand solvent extraction techniques were developed in order to produce high\r\npurity single rare earth solutions or compounds.  Alternate methods to\r\nconcentrate, recover and separate rare earths include precipitation and\r\ncoprecipitation, electrochemical and membrane processes, adsorption as well as\r\noxidation and reduction processes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSolvent extraction is generally\r\naccepted as the primary commercial technology for separating rare earths. Rare\r\nearth solvent extraction processes are generally classified as primary\r\nseparations, which focus on separating rare earth elements from other elements,\r\nand secondary separations, which produce single or mixed (typically 2 or 3)\r\nrare earth products from mixed rare earth streams that are produced by primary\r\nseparations.

The criticality\r\nassessment was framed in two dimensions: importance to clean energy and supply\r\nrisk. Five rare earth elements (REE)—dysprosium, terbium, europium, neodymium\r\nand yttrium—were found to be critical in the short term (2011–2015). These five\r\nREE are used in magnets for wind turbines and electric vehicles or phosphors in\r\nenergy-efficient lighting. Other elements—cerium, indium, lanthanum and\r\ntellurium—were found to be near-critical.

Five rare earth elements (REE)—dysprosium, terbium, europium, neodymium\r\nand yttrium—were found to be critical in the short term (2011–2015). These five\r\nREE are used in magnets for wind turbines and electric vehicles or phosphors in\r\nenergy-efficient lighting.

LTPs are continuing to enable technological\r\nadvances in new fields, such as destruction of antibiotic resistant bacteria\r\nand cancer therapy in plasma medicine. All of these advances are enabled by the\r\nunique properties of low-temperature, non-equilibrium plasmas and the chemistry\r\nthey drive. Building upon fundamental plasma science, further developments are\r\nsought in plasma sources, plasma-surface interactions, and plasma control\r\nscience that can enable new plasma technologies, marketable product, or impact\r\nin other areas or disciplines leading to even greater societal benefit. The\r\nfocus of this topic is utilizing fundamental plasma science knowledge and\r\nturning it into new applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLTP science and engineering addresses research and\r\ndevelopment in partially ionized gases with electron temperatures typically\r\nbelow 10 eV.

The\r\nstrategic plan for HEP includes initiatives on the energy and intensity\r\nfrontiers, relying on accelerators capable of delivering beams of the required\r\nenergy and intensity. As high energy physics facilities get bigger and more\r\ncostly, the DOE HEP program seeks to develop advanced technologies that can be\r\nused to reduce the overall machine size and cost, and also to develop new\r\nconcepts and capabilities that further scientific and commercial needs beyond\r\nHEP’s discovery science mission.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn many cases the technology sought is closely tied to a\r\nspecific machine concept which sets the specifications (and tolerances) for the\r\ntechnology. Applicants are strongly encouraged to review the references\r\nprovided. Applications to subtopics specifically associated with a machine\r\nconcept that do not closely adhere to the specifications of the machine will be\r\nconsidered non- responsive.

However, it is essential\r\nthat as these promising ML methods are experimentally demonstrated before being\r\ndeployed at user facilities. The ability to generalize the training and\r\ndeployment of ML algorithms to different operating configurations for the same\r\nbeamline, or between facilities, remains a challenge. Proposals are sought to\r\ndevelop novel algorithms and associated software to support the training and\r\ndeployment of ML tools at accelerator facilities. Developments, which\r\nfacilitate domain transfer between facilities and diagnostic types, are highly encouraged.\r\nSuccessful proposals must include plans for experimental demonstration and\r\nvalidation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: John Boger, john.boger@science.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.     \r\nAdaptive Online Machine Learning for Dynamic Beam Diagnostics\r\n\r\nParticle accelerators are large\r\ncomplex systems composed of hundreds to thousands of interconnected\r\nelectro-magnetic components including radio frequency (RF) resonant\r\naccelerating structures for beam acceleration and longitudinal focusing and\r\nvarious magnets for beam steering and transverse focusing. Charged particle\r\nbeams are themselves complex objects living in a six-dimensional phase space.\r\nThey undergo complex collective effects such as coherent synchrotron radiation\r\nand vary with time in unpredictable ways. Sources of variation include\r\naccelerator RF phase and amplitude jitter, and magnet current jitter, and\r\ntime-varying laser intensities and photoemission at the beam source.

Techniques for\r\nrevealing the causes of LIDT performance variations are of interest and include\r\nsuch techniques as fluorescence microscopy and photo-thermal heterodyne\r\ninterferometry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInstruments for Large-Aperture\r\nOptic Characterization. Equally important are high accuracy optical\r\ncharacterization capabilities suitable for large-format HAP and HPP optics that\r\ncan range from cm-scale nonlinear crystals to meter-scale diffraction gratings.\r\nProperties such as the reflected/diffracted/transmitted wavefront error,\r\ndispersion uniformity, and doping concentration uniformity need to be\r\naccurately measured at sufficient spatial resolution (e.g. millimeter or\r\nbetter) over the full optical aperture. Stitching interferometry for linear\r\noptics, like mirrors & gratings, and deuteration mapping for DKDP crystals\r\nare of particular interest. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe successful proposal will\r\npropose (1) the development of an instrument, (2) measurement techniques,\r\nincluding data reduction and error estimation, (3) measurement validation and\r\ncalibration techniques, and (4) complete a set of demonstration measurements on\r\nultrafast HAP optics. An instrument capable of multiple simultaneous\r\nmeasurements (e.g., LIDT and doping concentration) would offer added efficiency\r\nand is especially interesting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinal demonstration measurements\r\nmust be made in the near-IR (0.7-2.5 micron wavelengths) for ultrafast optics\r\n(10% bandwidth). If proposing an instrument to characterize LIDT, spatial\r\nresolution must be better than 1 mm, and the instrument must be capable of\r\nmapping a 4 cm diameter aperture, minimum. If proposing a dopant concentration\r\ninstrument, accuracy must be 0.05 at% or better in the dopant concentration,\r\nwith a spatial resolution of 1 mm or better. If proposing a wavefront\r\ncharacterization instrument, accuracy must be lambda/10 RMS or better over a 10\r\ncm x 10 cm single field, and the instrument must have the capability to\r\naccurately stitch fields together over at least a 100 cm x 100 cm full aperture\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Eric Colby, eric.colby@science.doe.gov  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

As larger area detectors are required for\r\ntracking and also for new applications such as high granularity calorimetry,\r\nlower manufacturing cost is needed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor use in high energy physics,\r\ndetectors must withstand both ionizing and displacement damage radiation, and\r\nthey must have fast signal collection and fast readout as well as radiation\r\ntolerance in the range 100 to 1000 Mrad and 1E14 to 2E16 neutron equivalent\r\nfluence. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOf interest are monolithic CMOS-based\r\nsensors with moderate depth (5-20 micron) high resistivity substrates that can\r\nbe fully depleted and can achieve charge collection times of 20 ns or less.\r\nTechnologies of interest include deep n- and p-wells to avoid parasitic charge\r\ncollection in CMOS circuitry and geometries with low capacitance charge\r\ncollection nodes.  We aim for stitched, large area arrays of sensors with\r\nsensor thickness less than 50 microns and pixel pitch of less than 25 microns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso of interest are low to\r\nmoderate gain (x10-50) reach-through silicon avalanche diodes (LGADs) as a\r\nproposed sensor type to achieve ~10 ps time resolution for collider\r\nexperiments. The current generation of reach-through diodes suffers from large\r\nfractional dead area at the edges of the pixel and only moderate radiation\r\nhardness. A moderately doped thin buried (~5 micron) layer replacing a\r\nreach-through implant can address some of these problems.  We seek substrate\r\nfabrication technologies to improve the radiation hardness  and stability of these\r\ndevices by using graded epitaxy or wafer bonding to produce a buried and\r\nmoderately doped (1E16) thin buried gain layer on a high resistivity substrate.\r\nWe also seek techniques to arrange internal doping of detectors by multiple\r\nthick epitaxial layers or other methods to allow engineering of the internal\r\nfields and resulting pulse shape.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Helmut\r\nMarsiske, helmut.marsiske@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.     \r\nSingle Electron Transistors for Exotic Force and Particle Searches\r\n\r\nSingle electron transistors (SETs)\r\ncan control the locations of individual electrons with high fidelity and can do\r\nso at relatively warm temperatures of 3K and above. These systems are\r\nfabricated by large CMOS foundries and offer all the attendant advantages.\r\nAlthough the unit of sensing is a single electron, there is the potential to\r\nachieve significantly lower noise level by various methods. External signals\r\ncan be coupled to the circuitry by electric fields, magnetic fields, light,\r\nmechanical force, etc., which may allow novel ways to explore the exotic force\r\nand matter parameter space. Proposals are sought to develop SET-based\r\nlow-noise, cryogenic systems that enable future, more sensitive exotica\r\nsearches.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Helmut\r\nMarsiske, helmut.marsiske@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.      \r\nHigh Density Chip Interconnect Technology\r\n\r\nWith the large channel counts and\r\nfine granularity of high energy physics detectors, there is an ever-increasing\r\nneed for new technologies for higher-density interconnects. Grant applications\r\nare sought for the development of new technologies for reducing cost while\r\nincreasing the density of interconnection of pixelated sensors to readout\r\nelectronics by enhancing or replacing solder bump-based technologies.\r\nDevelopment of cost-effective technologies to connect arrays of thinned\r\nintegrated circuits (< 50 microns, with areas of ~2x2 cm^2) to\r\nhigh-resistivity silicon sensors with interconnect pitch of 50 microns or less\r\nare of interest. Technologies are sought that can minimize dead regions at\r\ndevice edges and/or enable wafer-to-wafer interconnection, by utilizing 3D\r\nintegration with through-silicon vias or other methods. Present commercial chip\r\npackaging and mounting technologies can, at cryogenic temperatures, put\r\nmechanical stress on the silicon die which distort the operation of the\r\ncircuit. Low cost and robust packaging and / or interconnect solutions that do\r\nnot introduce such stresses would be of advantage – especially in the case of\r\nlarge area circuit boards (> 0.5 m on each edge).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Helmut\r\nMarsiske, helmut.marsiske@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.     \r\nRadiation-Hard High-Bandwidth Data Transmission for Detectors at High\r\nEnergy Colliders\r\n\r\nDetector data volumes at future\r\ncolliders will be nearly 100 times more than today. Single subdetectors will\r\nhave to transmit 10s to 100s of Tbps. While commercial off the shelf data\r\ntransmission solutions will deliver the needed performance in the near future,\r\nthese products cannot be used in future colliders for two main reasons: they\r\nwill not function in a high radiation environment (hundreds of Mrad), and they\r\nare in general too massive to be placed inside detectors, where added mass\r\ndegrades the measurements being made. Two main industrial developments are\r\ntherefore of interest: very low mass, high bandwidth electrical cables, and\r\nradiation hard optical transceivers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElectrical cables may be twisted\r\npair, twinax, etc., with as low as possible mass (and therefore small size)\r\nwhile compatible with multi-Gbps per lane transmission over distances up to\r\n10m. Cable fabrication using aluminum, copper clad aluminum, or non-metallic\r\nconductors (such as CNT thread), is of interest. Many dielectrics are not\r\nradiation hard, so fabrication with non-standard dielectrics is important. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOptical transceivers up to 100\r\nGbps will be needed. Many off the shelf commercial products meet or exceed the\r\nrequired bandwidth, but contain circuits that fail when exposed to ionizing\r\nradiation doses of hundreds of Mrad. Radiation hardened versions of commercial\r\ntransceivers (or equivalent) are therefore of interest, where radiation\r\nhardness is achieved without adding mass or increasing size, for example by\r\ndesign changes to the integrated circuits used, specifically radiation hard\r\ndevice modeling and library development of deep sub-micron CMOS fabrication\r\nprocesses.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals that do not address the\r\nrequired level of radiation hardness will be considered non-responsive.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Helmut\r\nMarsiske, helmut.marsiske@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.     \r\nElectronics and Frequency Multiplexed DAQ Systems for Low-Temperature\r\nExperiments \r\n\r\nMany HEP experiments are operated\r\nin the deep cryogenic regime (10-100 mK) with large numbers of readout channels\r\nrequired.  Data acquisition and controls signals from the mK stage out to room\r\ntemperature require high-fidelity RF signals, extremely low noise, and low\r\nthermal load on the cryogenic systems.  Applications range from future CMB\r\nexperiments that will have large focal plane arrays with ~500,000\r\nsuperconducting detector elements, to axion dark matter searches with similar\r\nchannel count to reach to high axion masses, to large-scale phonon-based WIMP\r\ndark matter searches.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest\r\ninclude: Low-noise cryogenic amplifiers (HEMT, SQUID, Parametric, etc.);\r\nHigh-density cryogenic interconnects for mK to LHe temperature stages; Scalable\r\nhigh-density superconducting interconnects for micro-fabricated superconducting\r\ndevices; High-frequency superconducting flex circuits; Specialized electronics\r\nfor processing large numbers of frequency-domain multiplexed RF signals; Wafer\r\nprocessing combining niobium metal and MEMS; Fabrication of miniature,\r\nultra-low loss, superconducting resonator arrays; and Electronic frequency\r\ntuning mechanisms for microwave resonators.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Helmut\r\nMarsiske, helmut.marsiske@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nf.       \r\nHigh-Channel Count Electronic Tools for Picosecond (ps) Timing \r\n\r\nHigh precision timing measurements\r\nin next generation detectors will require the development of circuitry to\r\nmeasure time to 1 ps or better over channel counts that may exceed 100,000.

High detection efficiency is also vital to quantum networks of\r\nsensors. Proposals are sought for production, testing, and/or validation of\r\nphotodetector systems with high speed (>5GHz) and high quantum efficiency\r\n(>99%) capable of detecting continuous variable quantum information in\r\ntelecom and NIR wavelengths. In some sensing protocols, coherent detection is\r\nrequired to properly characterize signals and noise and to detect the presence\r\nof entanglement in optical fields. High efficiency (>99%) and high speed\r\n(>1GHz) homodyne detectors are needed in order to enable advanced sensing\r\nand networking applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: John Boger, john.boger@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.      \r\nTechnology for Co-existence of Traditional Data and Quantum Information\r\nOver Long Distances\r\n\r\nIn order to most efficiently use\r\nresources including optical fiber, there is a need to have quantum states\r\npropagate along the same fiber that simultaneously carries traditional data\r\ntraffic. The presence of traditional data signals can cause various noise and\r\ninterference effects including Raman scattering and four-wave mixing. Since\r\nquantum signals are sensitive to background light levels of <<1 photon,\r\nthese unwanted effects can seriously limit the amount of optical power that can\r\nbe launched into the fiber and thereby limit the data rate that can be\r\ntransmitted. One mitigation technique is to use a classical data wavelength\r\nthat is much longer than the quantum wavelength. However, there is also the\r\ndesire to have as low a loss at the quantum wavelength as possible, which is\r\ntypically near 1550 nm. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis project will study means to\r\nallow quantum and classical data to co-propagate over long distances. Any\r\nsuitable designs including the use or optimization of Raman amplifiers,\r\nwavelength engineering, polarization control, modulation format, or any other\r\ntechnique can be considered provided it does not assume time-synchronization\r\nbetween all the channels which is seen as overly constrictive. A metric of the\r\nmaximum data rate possible over 100 km of fiber propagation to maintain a ratio\r\nof quantum signal to classical noise of >10 is one way to assess the overall\r\nperformance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: John Boger, john.boger@science.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.

"subtopic_description": " \r\n\r\nc.      \r\nTechnology for Co-existence of Traditional Data and Quantum Information\r\nOver Long Distances\r\n\r\nIn order to most efficiently use\r\nresources including optical fiber, there is a need to have quantum states\r\npropagate along the same fiber that simultaneously carries traditional data\r\ntraffic. The presence of traditional data signals can cause various noise and\r\ninterference effects including Raman scattering and four-wave mixing. Since\r\nquantum signals are sensitive to background light levels of <<1 photon,\r\nthese unwanted effects can seriously limit the amount of optical power that can\r\nbe launched into the fiber and thereby limit the data rate that can be\r\ntransmitted. One mitigation technique is to use a classical data wavelength\r\nthat is much longer than the quantum wavelength. However, there is also the\r\ndesire to have as low a loss at the quantum wavelength as possible, which is\r\ntypically near 1550 nm. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis project will study means to\r\nallow quantum and classical data to co-propagate over long distances.

This topic addresses several key areas that support the\r\ndevelopment of crosscutting and specific reactor and fuel cycle technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought in the following subtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nWireless Technology for Nuclear Instrumentation and Control Systems\r\n(Crosscutting Research)\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Sensors and\r\nInstrumentation program seeks applications to develop wireless instrumentation\r\nfor nuclear applications, especially for advanced reactors. Currently,\r\nelectrical cables are critical infrastructure necessary to operate a Nuclear\r\nPower Plant (NPP) effectively and safely. A typical NPP has more than 1,000 km\r\nof power, control, instrumentation and other cables within the plant and the\r\ncost of construction and maintenance is significant. When considering advanced\r\ncontrol modes for future reactor concepts, including microreactors, cables\r\nperformance degradation in radioactive environments becomes an important\r\nlimiting factor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWireless technology is\r\nincreasingly deployed for the improvement and cost optimization of several\r\ncommon industrial applications, for example the use of Radio-Frequency\r\nIdentification (RFID) in the distribution and retail sector. Proposals should\r\nconsider how technical solutions with proven performance in other applications,\r\noutside of the nuclear industry, could be adapted to improve the performance\r\nand cost-effectiveness of nuclear systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicants should focus on the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelop wireless technology to measure and transmit data on\r\nsystem temperature, pressure, forces, acceleration, vibration, and the health\r\nof structural components.

Advanced technologies are desired for Advanced Reactors and\r\nfuels for sodium and lead fast reactors.  Specific technologies that improve\r\nthe safety, reliability, and performance in normal operation as well as in\r\naccident conditions are desired.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelop and/or demonstrate coating methods capable of coating\r\ninternal cladding tube surface with metallic zirconium. The thickness of the\r\ncoating material should be approximately 12-25 µm thick extending at least 1\r\nmeter into a 2-meter-long tube.  Cladding diameter dimensions are approximately\r\n6.86 mm OD x 0.56 mm wall. It is also important that the coating can be\r\ninspected to verify coating thickness along the entire coating length and\r\nidentify any coating flaws such as scratches or areas of thinner coating.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelop and/or demonstrate high temperature (300-600C) pilger\r\nprocessing of tubing for fast reactor cladding applications. Methods are needed\r\nto produce thin walled high strength cladding for fast reactor fuel\r\napplications out of materials with low tensile ductility.  Typical thicknesses\r\nare ~0.5 mm and cladding diameters are ~6 mm.  Length of tubes are ~3 m. \r\nMethods must produce tubes that are free from defects such as cracks or pits. \r\nTubes must maintain a circular cross-section over the length of the tubes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelop and/or demonstrate additive manufacturing methods for\r\nproducing reactor core materials for fast reactor applications, including ducts\r\nor thin walled cladding.  Method must produce fully dense materials unless the\r\nporosity can be beneficial to the application of the material.  Properties of\r\nadditive manufactured materials need to be equal to or better than the\r\nmaterials they are replacing.

Specifically, MPACT develops innovative technologies and\r\ntools which enable the integration of safeguards and security features into the\r\ndesign and operation of nuclear fuel cycles. Examples include processes such as\r\nadvanced reactor fuel recycling via aqueous or electrochemical means, advanced\r\nreactor fuel fabrication, and other process control applications.  Grant\r\napplications are requested for:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInert Hot Cell Gamma Spectroscopy. Medium/high resolution (3-7%)\r\ngamma spectroscopy systems that can operate in a dry inert (e.g. Ar) hot cell.\r\nDevelopment of such system would assist in hot cell surveys, material location\r\n& identification, and potentially material quantification for NMAC.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nActinide Sensitive Materials Research. Identify and develop\r\nmaterials with actinide-selective sensitivities for advanced fuel cycle\r\napplications. These applications may include high temperatures, molten salts,\r\nliquid sodium, or liquid lead. Identifying and characterizing materials that\r\nmay demonstrate actinide sensitivity under these conditions will advance U.S.\r\nNMAC capabilities for future reactors by qualitatively or quantitatively\r\nindicating actinide concentrations.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nNeutron detectors. Neutron detectors for Nuclear Material\r\nAccountancy and Control (NMAC) traditionally are 3He, 10B, or 6Li based due to\r\nthe large thermal neutron cross section and detector infrastructure that\r\nenables neutron multiplicity measurements. However, optimization of these\r\ndetector designs has not occurred for high rate applications (high neutron,\r\nhigh gamma, or high neutron and gamma). Recent pushes to directly measure Pu in\r\nspent fuel have focused on overall system designs, but not sup-component\r\n(detector-level) optimization. This optimization has the potential to\r\nsignificantly advance neutron assay with benefits to NMAC needs at the back end\r\nof the nuclear fuel cycle (Pu verification in spent fuel, storage,\r\nreprocessing, and waste).\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAcquisition electronics for neutron assay systems. Current\r\npreamplifiers for assay systems utilize mature technology, but commercially\r\navailable electronics do not exploit amplifier component advances over the past\r\ndecade. It should be possible to develop preamplifier electronics that have 1)\r\nzero deadtime, 2) effectively discriminate between neutron and gamma pulses,\r\nand 3) enable independent neutron and gamma counting with neutron multiplicity\r\ncapabilities. Additionally, these preamplifiers should be rugged, able to\r\noperate under industrial conditions and over a wide humidity range.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications that address\r\nborder security or remote monitoring are not sought.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Michael Reim,\r\nmichael.reim@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.     \r\nAdvanced Modeling and Simulation\r\n\r\nComputational modeling of nuclear\r\nreactors for design and operation is becoming increasingly predictive and able\r\nto leverage high-performance computing architectures.  While these tools\r\nperform similarly to legacy tools for simple problems, utilizing the advanced\r\nfeatures of these tools requires more in-depth training, skills, and knowledge. \r\nFurthermore, in order to integrate robust multi-physics capabilities and\r\ncurrent production tools for ease-of-use and deployment to end users, and for\r\nenabling the use of high-fidelity simulations to inform lower-order models for\r\nthe design, analysis, and licensing of advanced nuclear systems and\r\nexperiments, it is worthwhile to invest in technologies that ease the adoption\r\nof these modern computational tools.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought that\r\napply Office of Nuclear Energy’s (NE) advanced modeling and simulation tools https://inl.gov/neams/ to industry problems\r\nfor increased use by industry, either light-water reactor (LWR) or non-LWR\r\nreactor industry. This can include:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nFacilitate access to Office of Nuclear Energy’s (NE) advanced\r\nmodeling and simulation tools for inexperienced users;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nApply the results of high-fidelity simulations to inform the\r\nimproved use of lower-order models for improved use of fast-running design\r\ntools; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nProvide capabilities for automated verification of numerical\r\nsolutions, including mesh refinement studies;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nUse of the tools with existing plant operational data to\r\ndemonstrate the value for real-world industry applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: David\r\nHenderson, David.Henderson@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.     \r\nMaterials Research\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nNondestructive Examination (NDE) Techniques for In-situ Monitoring of\r\nCable Insulation\r\n\r\nNondestructive examination (NDE)\r\ntechniques for in-situ monitoring of cable insulation is an important component\r\nof aging management and sustainable operation of the US nuclear power plant\r\nfleet. This call seeks proposals focused on the development and improvement of\r\nonline cable monitoring methods for aging management, reduced cost, and/or\r\nimproved reliability.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSeveral methods exist for\r\ndetermining the condition of installed cables of importance in an operating\r\nnuclear power plant, both at accessible locations along the length of the cable\r\nand of bulk cable health from the terminal ends of cables. Most cable analysis\r\nmethods, however, are applied when the cables are not energized and often with\r\ncables disconnected from their circuits.  The ability to monitor cable\r\ncondition on-line (continuously during operation) or at least without disconnecting\r\nor de-energizing the cables could greatly reduce the time and expense\r\nassociated with cable monitoring.  Utilization of such methods may not\r\nonly reduce cable aging management costs but could increase operational safety\r\nand maintenance efficiency through enabling a larger fraction of plant cables\r\nto be assessed simultaneously or per outage.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of possible methods\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nfiber optics for distributed temperature sensing of component\r\nlocal environments;\r\n\r\n·        \r\non-line spread spectrum time domain reflectometry for circuit\r\nhealth monitoring;\r\n\r\n·        \r\non-line FDR (frequency domain reflectometry) or JTFDR (joint\r\ntime-frequency domain reflectometry);\r\n\r\n·        \r\non-line partial discharge testing for low/medium voltage cables\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nDevelop or Improve Small Scale Mechanical Testing Techniques to\r\nProvide Size-independent Material Properties of Alloys in an NPP Environment\r\n\r\nReactor metallic materials are\r\nsubjected to a challenging core environment with complex mechanical loads,\r\ncorrosive coolant, and intensive neutron irradiation during operation.  As\r\na result, the mechanical properties and service performance of reactor metals\r\ncan degrade considerably over time.  To assure the long-term\r\nsustainability and reliability of light water reactors, the extent of materials\r\ndegradation must be evaluated quantitatively with well-designed tests and\r\nrelevant materials.  Currently, most mechanical tests require full-scale,\r\nengineering-size samples to assure the adequate constraints and statistical\r\nsignificance. This imposes a significant challenge for testing\r\nneutron-irradiated materials which are highly radioactive and difficult to\r\nhandle experimentally.  Heavily shielded facilities with strict controls\r\nare often required for testing such samples.  Thus, mechanical test\r\nmethods with small-scale samples are highly desirable from both economic and\r\ntechnical stand points.  With the rapid development of digital and sensor\r\ntechnologies in recent decades, new opportunities have become available to\r\nminimize the test samples.  Proposals are sought to develop or improve the\r\nmechanical testing techniques to provide tensile, creep, fatigue, impact\r\ntoughness, fracture toughness, and stress corrosion cracking properties with\r\nminiature specimens to provide size-independent material properties.\r\nCoordinated effort with continuum models and simulations are encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Alison Hahn, Alison.Hahn@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nf.       \r\nFlexible Plant Operation & Generation\r\n\r\nIn order to assure continued operation\r\nof the current nuclear fleet in a climate of challenging economic conditions\r\nfor many plants, the Light Water Reactor Sustainability, Flexible Plant\r\nOperation and Generation program is seeking to enable nuclear plants to develop\r\nan alternate revenue source that can provide economic benefit and long-term\r\nsustainment.  The Department of Energy in association with nuclear plant owners\r\nand industrial partners are developing processes and technology that will allow\r\nnuclear plants to alternate between electrical power generation and direct\r\nenergy supply through production of green hydrogen or other energy carriers to\r\nindustrial manufacturing plants and clean energy users.  Flexible plant\r\noperation and generation will enable nuclear power plants to optimize their\r\nrevenue by dynamically responding to modern grid markets that are realizing\r\nhigher penetration of renewable energy and natural gas power plants.  The\r\nfollowing areas of technology development are needed:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.  &nbspnbsp;  \r\nImprovement of Software Tools\r\n\r\nThe Light Water Reactor\r\nSustainability program, in collaboration with Integrated Energy Systems have\r\ndeveloped software analytic tools to help ensure long term economic viability\r\nof currently operating nuclear power plants. The techno economic analysis\r\nneeded to validate the examined approaches are challenging and embrace grid\r\nmodeling, dynamic asset modeling and long-term financial planning. These tools,\r\ndeveloped in collaboration with the Integrated Energy System program, will\r\nallow the creation of models and processes to determine the most cost-effective\r\napproach to implementing hybrid energy systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional research is needed to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nFurther mature analytic software tools\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEnable the use of these tools by future customers by improving\r\ntheir usability and connecting them with already existing commercial tools\r\nwhere appropriate\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAdapt the tools to solve specialized problems related to the\r\ncurrent nuclear fleet and industrial customers\r\n\r\n·        \r\nApplication of the tools to demonstrate value for real-world\r\nindustry applications\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nSteam-to-steam Heat Exchanger for BWR Thermal Energy Heat\r\nExtraction and Delivery\r\n\r\nHeat exchanger concepts that raise\r\nsteam using steam with minimal loss of steam quality are needed.  The heat\r\nexchangers need to mitigate tritium migration to the secondary steam loop that\r\nwill deliver heat to industrial users, including potential food processing\r\nindustries, or industries that directly use steam for the production of a\r\nnon-electricity product.  Heat exchangers that adjust to variable flows\r\nare needed to support thermal energy dispatch between BWR power production and\r\ndelivery to the thermal energy user. Developing advanced, well-sealed,\r\nheat exchangers or improving their efficiency is consistent with the goals of\r\nDOE's Water Security Grand Challenge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Alison Hahn, Alison.Hahn@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ng.     \r\nEnhancement of LOGOS and SR2ML\r\n\r\nIndustry Equipment Reliability\r\n(ER) and asset management Programs are essential elements that help ensure the\r\nsafe and economical operation of nuclear power plants. There is an opportunity\r\nto significantly enhance the collection, analysis, and use of this information\r\nto provide more cost-effective plant operation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Risk-Informed Systems Analysis\r\n(RISA) Pathway has focused on the developments of tools (i.e., SR2ML and LOGOS)\r\nthat can integrate component/system reliability models, cost models, and\r\noptimization methods into one evaluation framework. The goal is to employ these\r\ntools with the INL developed code RAVEN to manage plant risk (both economic and\r\nsafety related) and manage plant resources (e.g., activity planning and\r\nscheduling). The development of these tools is coming to completion and they\r\nare planned to be released via open source in 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe SR2ML is a software package\r\nthat contains reliability models designed to be interfaced with RAVEN. These\r\nmodels can be used to perform both static and dynamic system risk analysis and\r\ndetermine risk importance of specific elements of the considered system. Two\r\nclasses of reliability models have been developed; the first class includes all\r\ntraditional reliability models while the second class includes several\r\ncomponent ageing models.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLOGOS contains a set of discrete\r\noptimization models that can be used for capital budgeting optimization\r\nproblems. This tool uses component health information (e.g., failure rate or\r\nfailure probability), various costs (e.g., maintenance, operations,\r\nreplacement), and plant budget constraints to provide the optimal set of projects\r\n(e.g., component replacement or refurbishment) that maximizes profit and\r\nsatisfies the provided requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe response to this call should\r\ntarget the enhancement of the INL-developed software tools LOGOS and SR2ML. In\r\nparticular, applications are sought in one of the following areas:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nData processing. The developed models require an interface with\r\nplant ER to gather information about past plant operational performance. This\r\ndata can be either text-based (e.g., operations logs, issue reports, work orders)\r\nor numerical (e.g., component testing data, prognostics and health management\r\ndata). There is a need to automatize this collection process such that ER data\r\ncan be automatically used by LOGOS and SR2ML to manage and optimize plant\r\nresources and activities (e.g., schedule maintenance and replacement).\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPlatform development. INL has focused on the development of the\r\nmodels and quantitative methods to manage and optimize plant maintenance\r\nactivities. There is a need to create a front-end computational platform that\r\ncan simplify the use of the developed models/methods and provide the user with\r\nconcise and adequate information. The goal is to improve the deployment\r\nfunctionalities of the developed models/methods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Alison Hahn, Alison.Hahn@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nh.     \r\nPlant Modernization\r\n\r\nImprovements and advancements are\r\nneeded to address nuclear power plant economic viability in current and future\r\nenergy markets through innovation, efficiency gains, and business model\r\ntransformation.  This includes transformative digital technologies that\r\nresults in broad innovation and business process improvement in the nuclear\r\nlight water reactor fleet’s operating model.  The modernization of plant systems\r\nand processes will enable a technology-centric business model platform that\r\nsupports improved performance at lower cost, contributing to the long term\r\nsustainability of the LWR fleet, which is vital to the nation’s energy and\r\nenvironmental security.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnology should demonstrate and\r\nsupport improved functionality and efficiencies in plant operation and\r\nmaintenance processes.  This will include improvements for both core\r\noperations and maintenance work activities, as well as support functions, such\r\nas security, management, administration, procurement, and radiation\r\nprotection.  Effective modernization requires improved process automation,\r\nmachine intelligence and computer aided decision making. To achieve this\r\nmission in the nuclear power industry, applications are sought in one of the\r\nfollowing plant modernization areas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nArtificial intelligence/machine learning technologies are sought\r\nfor troubleshooting and diagnosing nuclear plant operational problems to\r\nimprove the timeliness and effectiveness of response to emergent degraded\r\nconditions. These technologies should enable significant savings in engineering\r\nand technical support costs. These technologies should\r\nbe able to integrate into plant processes for automated assessment and\r\ncorrection, including corrective action program, risk management, and work\r\nmanagement functions.  Further, the technologies should enable third\r\nparty outsourcing of trouble shooting and diagnosis through data sharing and\r\nremote collaboration capabilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDigital twin technologies for operating nuclear plants are sought\r\nto reduce costs in plant monitoring and performance deviation detection. These\r\ntechnologies are intended to enhance operational monitoring by detecting\r\nanomalies much lower than instrument setpoints, validating them as real plant\r\nphenomena verses sensor malfunctions, determining the deviation trend rate, and\r\nidentifying the degraded component.  The technologies will differentiate\r\ncascade effects in connected plant systems from the system with the degraded\r\ncomponent. The logic of the digital twin will be transparent and immediately\r\navailable for rapid verification by plant operators and support staff.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nSelf-diagnosis and health monitoring technologies for nuclear\r\nplant components are sought for elimination of plant surveillances and other\r\nforms of periodic testing, enabling exclusive use of condition-based monitoring\r\nfor applicable classes of plant components.  For these components, all\r\ncredible failure modes will be addressed, with condition status transmitted on\r\na user-specified frequency. The condition information will support real-time\r\nrisk monitoring and operational determination.

As high temperature reactors, they offer increased power conversion\r\nefficiency, high temperature process heat, reduced waste heat rejection, the\r\npossibility of dry heat rejection, and increased fissile resource utilization.\r\nMSRs can be deployed at gigawatt-scale or as small modular reactors. This\r\nflexibility, along with improved heat rejection characteristics, greatly\r\nexpands siting opportunities for MSRs. Low-pressure operation with chemically\r\ninert coolants allows for thinner walled components that may be significantly\r\nless expensive. Many major plant components could potentially be replaceable.\r\nThe ability to continually process fission products out of the reactor system\r\nchanges the nature of accident scenarios and could allow for important\r\ninnovations such as passive, walk-away safety and a meaningful reduction of\r\nsite emergency planning zones. MSRs are versatile and powerful machines and can\r\nassist in closing the fuel cycle by reuse of fuel and by consumption of surplus\r\nfissile inventories.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDOE is seeking proposals for\r\ncollaborative small business partnerships from a U.S. company or companies to\r\nadvance Molten Salt Reactors and foster growth for U.S. industry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPotential areas of collaboration\r\ninclude but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of a small fuel salt pump to support either side\r\nstream processing or small experimental loops.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of multi-use fuel salt flange connection suitable for\r\nconnection/disconnection with remote tooling.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDemonstration of a mechanical molten salt line containment\r\nisolation valve that remains functional during station blackout conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Brian K.\r\nRobinson, Brian.Robinson@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nj.       \r\nAdvanced Methods for Manufacturing\r\n\r\nAMM program is seeking proposals\r\nthat can enhance the economics and flexibility of the advanced manufacturing\r\ntechnologies: develop and mature manufacturing technologies that facilitate\r\nmodular designs and the construction, enhancement of the modular manufacturing\r\ntechnologies, and decreased necessity of field modifications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample: emerging powder\r\nmetallurgy techniques for fabricating nuclear components offer many benefits,\r\nincluding part consolidation, reduced requirements for field fabrication and\r\nwelding, the potential replacement of forging technics for pressure vessels and\r\nlarger systems, advance construction technics include concrete modularizations\r\nand similar concepts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Dirk\r\nCairns-Gallimore, dirk.cairns-gallimore@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information on the AMM\r\nprogram visit https://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-energy-enabling-technologies\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nk.     \r\nNuclear Science User Facilities\r\n\r\nThe Nuclear Science User\r\nFacilities (NSUF) has strong interest in the development of new and advanced\r\ntechniques that will enable cutting edge and more cost effective studies\r\nrelated to irradiation effects in nuclear fuels and materials. In addition to\r\nincreasing the fundamental understanding associated with irradiation effects,\r\nNSUF also strives to accelerate both the discovery of new materials that can be\r\napplied to the needs of the nuclear industry and the ultimate qualification of\r\nthose materials. Development of high-throughput characterization techniques are\r\ntherefore of great relevance. Some of the most important yet most difficult\r\nproperties to measure with high-throughput methodologies are mechanical\r\nproperties. Proposals focused on the development of techniques for\r\nhigh-throughput characterization in the area of mechanical property\r\ndeterminations and especially with respect to radioactive materials will be\r\naccepted. Of particular interest are techniques for bulk material mechanical\r\nproperties as well as studies to correlate bulk mechanical properties to those\r\nobtained from high-throughput techniques on micro- or nano-scale samples.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Tansel\r\nSelekler, Tansel.Selekler@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information on the NSUF\r\nprogram visit https://nsuf.inl.gov/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nl.       \r\nTransformational Challenge Reactor\r\n\r\nThe Transformational Challenge\r\nReactor (TCR) program provides a revolutionary platform to help demonstrate the\r\nability to reduce the deployment costs and timelines for nuclear energy\r\nsystems.

Additionally, new fabrication options afforded by additive manufacturing,\r\nunleash opportunities that did not exist before, and allow probing directly\r\ninto materials. While standard measurements, such as temperature and strain are\r\nobvious sensing modalities, these options can be expanded through a robust\r\nresearch program.

The IES\r\nprogram, in collaboration with other DOE programs such as Light Water Reactor\r\nSustainability, is developing tools and technologies that will enable nuclear\r\nenergy systems, both current fleet and advanced reactors, to support multiple\r\nrevenue streams by incorporating applications beyond grid electricity\r\nproduction, such as hydrogen production, industrial process heat, and water\r\ndesalination/purification.  Key to the success of these systems is the\r\ninclusion of reliable integration hardware, and instrumentation that will allow\r\nfor secure, resilient system control under a range of operating scenarios. The\r\nIES program focuses on implementation options for advanced, non-water cooled,\r\nnuclear reactor concepts that leverage the availability of high-quality heat to\r\nsupport a range of industrial applications. Proposals that further enhance the\r\ntechnology readiness level of various system components are desired. Concepts\r\nmay include:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nCompact heat exchangers;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nHeat transfer components that isolate the nuclear system from\r\ndownstream end users;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nSmart valves and related integration hardware;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEmbedded sensors that support equipment and component health\r\nmonitoring;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nData acquisition and management systems that incorporate advanced\r\ninformatics and decision systems to support optimized system control and ensure\r\ncyber secure operation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntroduction of technologies that\r\nreduce environmental impacts, such as water withdrawals, using IES are also of\r\nsignificant interest, consistent with the goals of DOE's Water Security Grand\r\nChallenge.  Potential supply chain challenges that could be presented by\r\nintroduction of new technologies in commercial application of advanced reactor\r\nbased IES should also be addressed as a component of these proposals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to the focus on system\r\nelements and interface technologies, the DOE laboratories have also developed\r\nnumerous computational tools to support the complex techno-economic analyses\r\nneeded to validate candidate system design approaches, incorporating grid\r\nmodeling, dynamic asset modeling, and long-term financial planning. Proposals\r\nthat focus on further maturing and commercializing these dynamic, system-level\r\nanalysis and optimization tools, particularly in the area of advanced reactor\r\napplications, are of interest.  Proposals that would enhance industry\r\nutilization of these tools through connection with existing commercial tools,\r\nwhen appropriate and necessary, and increasing the ability to evaluate the potential\r\nfor nuclear energy to support of a range of industry applications, will also be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Rebecca\r\nOnuschak, Rebecca.Onuschak@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\no.     \r\nSmall Modular Reactor Capabilities, Components, and Systems\r\n\r\nImprovements and advancements are\r\nneeded to address capabilities, components, and systems that might be deployed\r\nin small modular reactor (SMR) designs, focusing on safe and efficient\r\noperations under potentially different pressure and temperature conditions, as\r\nwell as the need to fit into more confined configurations than might be\r\navailable in larger designs. The economics of SMRs depend on designing plants\r\nthat have fewer and smaller components, smaller site footprints, and a reduced\r\namount of operations and maintenance requirements than for reactors in the\r\nexisting fleet. Concepts that can potentially improve SMR plant capability and\r\nperformance while reducing capital, construction, operations, and maintenance costs\r\nare sought through this work scope. The proposed technology or capability\r\nshould demonstrate and support improved functionality and efficiencies in SMR\r\nplant operation and maintenance processes. Proposed technology improvements can\r\nbe applicable to any SMR design types (e.g., light water, liquid metal, gas,\r\nand molten salt cooled) and to both electrical or non-electrical uses, but\r\nshould be available on a timeframe to support SMR deployments in the early\r\n2030’s and compatible with an SMR design currently under development. Proposals\r\nshould identify any support function benefits such as in the areas of security,\r\nmanagement, administration, procurement, and radiation protection that could\r\nresult through the implementation of the proposed technology improvement. Due\r\nto the limited funding available to support this specific work scope,\r\napplications are sought for improvements in the following areas only:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nCompact heat exchangers\r\n\r\n·        \r\nCompact steam generators\r\n\r\n·        \r\nReactor vessel penetration systems\r\n\r\n·        \r\nPressure vessel closure mechanisms\r\n\r\n·        \r\nRemote handling capabilities\r\n\r\n·        \r\nSteam isolation systems\r\n\r\n·        \r\nCondenser technologies\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals that address the\r\nfollowing technology development areas are NOT of interest for this subtopic\r\nand will be declined: new small modular reactor design concepts,\r\ninstrumentation and control capabilities, sensors, remote operations concepts,\r\nfuel design & development, and spent fuel storage & handling.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Rebecca\r\nOnuschak, Rebecca.Onuschak@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\np.     \r\nMicroreactor Applications, Unattended Operations, and Cost-Reduction\r\nTechnologies\r\n\r\nImprovements and advances are\r\nneeded in support of novel microreactor applications and unattended operations\r\nto support wide-spread deployment of these technologies.  Microreactors are\r\ndefined as low power (<20 MW) reactors that are easily transported to and\r\nfrom an application site (such as remote locations) and are based on a range of\r\nreactor technologies. Given their size, they are ideal for novel applications\r\nthat require substantial local power to areas where either there is no grid\r\naccess or where fuel transportation is challenging or not desired and for other\r\noff-grid applications that require highly reliable power or local ownership and\r\ncontrol of the power source. There is also a strong desire to minimize the\r\nrequirement for on-site operators and trained personnel, which will reduce\r\ncosts and enable wider use of microreactor technology. Therefore, this topic\r\nseeks new and innovative concepts and technologies that support the use of\r\nmicroreactor applications in the following areas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·        \r\nCivilian applications requiring 100’s of kW to MW-scale power in\r\nthe form of heat or electricity to support remote or non-remote uses.  These\r\napplications should specifically highlight the need and value of having a\r\nreliable source of energy provided by microreactors and have significant\r\npotential market opportunities.  These concepts should represent the use of the\r\nenergy, not generation.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies that support unattended and remote operations of\r\nmicroreactors and minimize on-site highly trained personnel, operators, and\r\nmaintenance staff.  The technologies should not be microreactor design specific\r\nbut may need to consider the operational characteristics of microreactors.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies that can result in significant reductions in\r\nmicroreactor costs that can expand their applications by increasing their\r\ncompetitiveness with other energy sources.  The technologies should not be\r\nmicroreactor design specific but may provide microreactor hardware, system, and\r\noperation cost reductions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals that address the\r\nfollowing technology development areas are NOT of interest for this subtopic\r\nand will be declined:  new microreactor concepts, non-civilian applications of\r\nmicroreactors, radioisotope power source applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas\r\nSowinski, Thomas.Sowinski@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nq.     \r\nDevelopment of Online Monitoring Technologies for Molten Salt Reactors\r\n\r\nMolten salt reactors (MSRs) use a\r\nvariety of salts, including fluoride and chloride-based salts, as coolants and\r\nsolvents for actinide-bearing fuel salts. During operation, fission product buildup\r\nin the salt impacts the salt redox potential, potentially creating a corrosive\r\nenvironment without proper redox control. Online surveillance of key salt\r\nparameters, such as the U3+/U4+ ratio and level of dissolved alloy constituents\r\n(e.g., Cr), is necessary to identify changes in salt chemistry and signal the\r\nneed to implement corrosion control technologies to ensure that the reactor is\r\noperating within proper safety limits. Grant applications are sought to develop\r\nonline monitoring technologies (e.g., spectroelectrochemical probes) capable of\r\nextended use in nuclear-relevant molten salts. The technology should possess\r\nhigh precision and accuracy, chemical and materials stability in the working\r\nenvironment, and extended lifetime (e.g., 6 months). For Phase 1 applications,\r\ndemonstration of the compatibility and stable operation of the technology in\r\nmolten salts for long durations and temperature cycling is essential. Novel\r\nonline monitoring technologies that can enable monitoring of key molten salt\r\nproperties are especially encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Christina\r\nLeggett, Christina.Leggett@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nr.      \r\nAdvanced and Small Reactor Physical Security Cost Reduction\r\n\r\nAdvanced and small nuclear\r\nreactors will not be competitive with natural gas plants unless they are able\r\nto drastically reduce physical protection costs. Both intrinsic and extrinsic\r\ndesign features should be considered that can significantly reduce either the\r\nup-front capital costs or the operational costs. New ideas or past work that\r\nhas evaluated these types of cost reductions should be considered. Of\r\nparticular interest is physical protection modeling and analysis that shows how\r\nnew designs or approaches affect performance metrics. There are also new and\r\nnovel physical protection approaches being evaluated in the DOE NE R&D\r\nprograms. Preparation of commercial modeling and simulation tools used for\r\nsecurity performance assessments to evaluate those approaches will help nuclear\r\nvendors with licensing efforts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Won Yoon, Won.Yoon@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ns.      \r\nOther\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specific\r\nsubtopics listed above, the Department invites grant applications in other areas\r\nthat fall within the scope of the topic description above.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Won Yoon, Won.Yoon@nuclear.energy.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopics a, c-u:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nUnited States Department of Energy. “Office of Nuclear Energy.” 2020, http://energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nUnited States Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy. “Nuclear\r\nenergy Research and Development Roadmap.” Report to Congress, 2010, https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/NuclearEnergy_Roadmap_Final.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nUnited States Department of Energy. “Fuel Cycle Research and\r\nDevelopment.” Office of Nuclear Energy, 2020, https://energy.gov/ne/fuel-cycle-technologies/fuel-cycle-research-developmen\r\nt\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory. “Technical Program Plan for INL Advanced\r\nReactor Technologies Technical Development Office/Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel\r\nDevelopment and Qualification Program.” Idaho National Laboratory,\r\nRevision 6, INL/MIS-10-20662, 2010, https://art.inl.gov/trisofuels/Lists/References/Attachments/44/PLN-3636_rev_6.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.     \r\nPetti, D., Bell, G., Gougar, H. “The DOE Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) Fuel\r\nDevelopment and Qualification Program.” 2005 International Congress on\r\nAdvances in Nuclear Power Plants, INEEL/CON-04-02416. 2005, https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:39005010\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.     \r\nGateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear. “DOE Microreactor Program\r\nOverview.” Technical Reports, Industry Workshop Presentations, 2020,  https://gain.inl.gov/SitePages/MicroreactorProgram.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic b:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory, “Overview of the U.S. DOE Accident Tolerant\r\nFuel Development Program.” U.S. DOE, Office of Scientific and Technical\r\nInformation, Top Fuel 2013, INL/CON-13-29288, 2013, http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1130553\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory. “Light Water Reactor Accident Tolerant Fuel\r\nPerformance Metrics.” Advanced Fuels Campaign, INL/EXT-13-29957, 2014, http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1129113\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory. “Advanced Fuels Campaign 2013 Accomplishments\r\nReport.” U.S. Department of Energy, OSTI, INL/EXT-13-30520, 2013, http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1120800\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory. “Advanced Fuels Campaign 2014 Accomplishments\r\nReport.” U.S. Department of Energy, OSTI, INL/EXT-14-33515, 2014, http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/1169217\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory Advanced Fuels Home Page. “Collaboration\r\nPortal Account.” U.S. DOE, INL, 2017 Accomplishments Report, 2020, https://nuclearfuel.inl.gov/afp/SitePages/Home.aspx\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.     \r\nIdaho National Laboratory. “Technical Program Plan for INL Advanced\r\nReactor Technologies Technical Development Office/Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel\r\nDevelopment and Qualification Program.” U.S. DOE, INL, Rev. 6,\r\nINL/MIS-10-20662, 2010, https://art.inl.gov/trisofuels/Lists/References/Attachments/44/PLN-3636_rev_6.pdf\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.     \r\nPetti, D., Bell, G., Gougar, H. “The DOE Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) Fuel\r\nDevelopment and Qualification Program.” 2005 International Congress on\r\nAdvances in Nuclear Power Plants, INEEL/CON-04-02416. 2005, https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:39005010",

Storage of\r\nSNF is occurring for longer periods than initially intended; therefore, it is\r\ndesirable to assess technical performance issues of the SNF storage systems and\r\ntransportation systems after extended durations. In the area of SNF disposal,\r\nresearch is directed toward generic repository disposal systems in argillite,\r\nsalt, and crystalline rock.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrant applications are sought only in the following\r\nsubtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nSpent Fuel and Waste Science and Technology, Disposal R&D\r\n\r\nAssessments of nuclear waste\r\ndisposal options start with waste package failure and waste form degradation\r\nand consequent mobilization of radionuclides, reactive transport through the\r\nnear field environment (waste package and engineered barriers), and transport\r\ninto and through the geosphere.  Science, engineering, and technology\r\nimprovements may advance our understanding of waste isolation in generic deep\r\ngeologic environments and will facilitate the characterization of the natural\r\nsystem and the design of an effective engineered barrier system for a\r\ndemonstrable safe total system performance of a disposal system.  DOE is\r\nrequired to provide reasonable assurance that the disposal system isolates the\r\nwaste over long timescales, such that engineered and natural systems work\r\ntogether to prevent or delay migration of waste components to the accessible\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMined geologic repository projects\r\nand ongoing generic disposal system investigations generate business and\r\nR&D opportunities that focus on current technologies.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a cost-effective system that provides an ultra-low latency mixed reality environment for end-to-end real-time collaboration between two geographically separated teams.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:  To provide increased situational awareness and decision-making capability, there is a desire to create an environment where the senior leaders and decision makers can have face-to-face collaborations in a virtual environment while sharing real-time critical information. The initial intended application is in the collaboration between senior leaders and remote ground control stations for unmanned systems operations.  \r\n\r\nScience fiction has presented examples of holo-decks where a person can become immersed in a virtual environment. Real world experiments have created advanced Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs) which provide an immersive experience but, in the past, due to size, cost, and complexity they were not viable options for operational use. Mixed reality (MR) where real and virtual worlds are merged is rapidly advancing and entering the consumer markets.\r\n\r\nThe solution should provide the ability for the senior leader to enter an environment where they feel that they are in the remote operations center and can interact with the remote team as if they were in the same room. This includes but is not limited to viewing and interacting with individuals, sensor feeds, air vehicle status, GIS data, etc. The solution should provide an ultra-low latency interface to reduce or eliminate the risk of virtual reality sickness and well as other off-putting side effects of virtual and mixed reality use.\r\n\r\nThe solution could be, but not limited to, a device that can be worn, entered, sat in, or sat in front of, to immerse and engage with users and data. The solution must be capable to transmit and display classified data. The solutions could have a permanent install system capable of meeting all the needs with a portable version transportable onboard aircraft and set-up in remote areas of the globe. \r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the concept. Include a plan to demonstrate an innovative environment where senior leaders and decision makers can virtually collaborate face-to-face while sharing real-time critical information. Initially, this would involve leadership and unmanned systems operation remote ground control stations.  \r\n\r\nPHASE II: The contractor will develop, install, integrate and demonstrate an affordable prototype system capable of ultra-low latency mixed reality environment for end-to-end real-time collaboration between two geographically separated teams.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Several government agencies (military and civil) require this capability to provide real-time collaboration in a mixed reality environment. Commercial interest in such a system for collaboration and data sharing is also anticipated.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLadwig P., Geiger C.

The effects should last for a short time period, i.e., 2-3 days, and be reversible with no long-term effects.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: “New advances in physiology, nutrition, neuroscience, and engineering now offer a significant potential to prevent (or reduce) the degradation of a warfighters cognitive and physical capabilities during conflict and substantially increase the performance of both combat personnel and the larger systems of which they are part” [1].\r\n\r\nWarfighters are exposed to, and engage in, environments and activities where degradation of cognitive and physical performance can have grave consequences. Conversely, advantages in speed, strength, surprise, and aggression will help achieve dominance against the enemy. \r\n\r\nThis topic solicits solutions radically improving and providing advantages to speed, strength, surprise, and aggression for warfighters through physiology, nutrition, neuroscience, and engineering. The topic is interested in big gains in capability versus minor improvements. These areas of interest include but are not limited to the following examples: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMethods to unlock increased human potential to provide increased endurance. \r\n\tNew and emerging trends in nutrition and supplementation increasing physical and cognitive performance. \r\n\t“Soft-Exo Skeletons” powered clothing to reduce fatigue and provide additional capabilities.  \r\n\tNew equipment and concepts radically improving warfighter performance. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution’s effects, if supplementation or stimulation based, should last for a short time period, i.e., 2-3 days, and be reversible with no long-term effects.  \r\n\r\nAny Human Subjects Research (HSR) must be conducted within the applicable guidelines associated with DoD funded research.

These new services and the infrastructure enabling them have, in turn, created a fast-changing environment for further development. Mission planning and design now takes place in this dynamic context.  The Air Force continues to deliver traditional capabilities but could do so more effectively and by wholly different approaches through exploiting and repurposing rapidly emerging space systems, services, components, and supporting infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn previous generations, Air Force missions have been planned over extended time periods, assuming the availability of certain Government assets, products, and supporting services, with the Government funding new developments that were required.  Techniques for analyzing missions and performing trades were created and honed with each new application.  Now, mission planners are presented with a fast-changing array of commercial services and unconventional mixes of commercially driven and Government-driven capabilities including new technology and software-defined systems, commodity spacecraft components, small satellite buses, and launch and ground systems services. The environment is dynamic, choices are greater, and mission development, including rapid progression from concept to systems requirements to preliminary design, should adapt as well.\r\n\r\nGiven a set of needs and goals in a broad space-related area, the Air Force will benefit from a rapid capability to interpret needs and opportunities, structure candidate mission architectures, assess available and emerging services and technologies that may be relevant to solutions, and proceed systematically through trades to arrive at multiple feasible approaches for satellite and system designs.  These in turn can be considered with respect to cost, schedule, and risk, and the likelihood and degree of meeting goals.  In most cases, the mission and satellite development capability will rapidly access and combine insight from multiple sources and companies.\r\n\r\nOverlaps in different space-related domains have blurred the lines of simpler, focused mission development.  Communications now involves geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), and low earth orbit (LEO) over multiple wavelengths, with different antenna types and more use of relays.  Satellites have greater on-board processing, increased potential for coordinated operation, more options for deployed subsystems and in-space changes.  Launch services are lower cost, more frequent and agile, with emerging options for orbit insertions and transfers.  Payloads are more programmable, adaptable and compact.  In addition, information management for space systems increasingly leverages software-defined systems and the cloud, from data management to scheduling and operations.\r\n\r\nMission and satellite design should keep pace with and help manage the complexity brought by these fast-evolving developments.  It is envisioned this will involve model-based design processes, techniques and methodologies to develop conceptual designs that include expedient leveraging of the best new commercially-available and open source tools.  A robust but flexible approach accessing knowledge across organizations will take appropriate advantage of software-driven automation and optimization. \r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the concept. Include a plan to demonstrate a rapid capability to interpret needs and opportunities, structure candidate mission architectures, assess available and emerging services and technologies potentially relevant to solutions.  The firm would then proceed systematically through trades to arrive at multiple feasible approaches for satellite and system designs to be considered in terms of cost, schedule, risk, and the ability to fully meet goals.  \r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and enhance the rapid space mission and satellite design capability, and demonstrate the utility in several Air Force need areas for missions that are at different stages of conceptual maturity, including where conceptual development has not yet begun.  Provide intermediate products to be assessed by planning teams, summarizing information capturing sensitivity of mission-level outcomes, including schedule, cost and risk, to key architecture and implementation decisions. Carry at least one mission through to system and satellite design and development, working with other performers to rapidly assess mission-level impacts of spacecraft, payload, operations, data processing, and other elements.  \r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The contractor will pursue commercialization of the technologies developed in Phase II for potential Government and commercial applications. Government applications include rapid concept development and maturation for emerging military space missions. There are potential commercial applications to space system design, and evaluation and assessment of new business ventures.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMartin, Gary, (2016) NewSpace: The Emerging Commercial Space Industry, https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160001188.pdf ;\r\n\tDatta, Anusuya, (2017) The NewSpace Revolution: The emerging commercial space industry and new technologies, https://www.geospatialworld.net/article/emerging-commercial-space-industry-new-technologies/ ;\r\n\tMalaek, Seyed.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a personal sampling device that allows novice users to accurately measure and document intermediate-level impulse noise and sub-concussive blast exposures experienced by Service Members in realistic operational environments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Recently there has been a great deal of concern in the US military about the potential cumulative health effects of repeated exposures to sub-concussive blasts. There is a short-term need to collect information about the frequency and intensity of blast exposures that Service Members are being exposed to when they conduct operational training using high-powered weapon systems and other military equipment. There is also a long-term need to develop enduring monitoring systems that can be used to measure all blast and impulse noise exposures a Service Member experiences over the entirety of his or her military career. \r\n\r\nCurrent impulse-noise measurement systems to measure personal exposures are not well-suited to meet these needs. Typically, impulse noise assessments are conducted on individual weapon systems prior to the fielding of that system. These measurements use laboratory grade equipment that is neither compact enough nor durable enough to be used for exposure measurements during field training events. Additionally, this sort of evaluation may not address real world use scenarios where personnel maneuver around the weapon system during firing according to changes in the tactical environment. Changes in position can significantly change noise exposure. Additionally, evaluations of the individual system rarely, if ever, take into account exposure to multiple noise sources concurrently.\r\n\r\nMost current technology for measuring long-term exposures to acoustic noise are focused on continuous noises, like the sounds generated by engines or machinery. This type of noise can be measured with noise dosimeters, which are relatively inexpensive, compact, lightweight, and durable enough to be attached to a Service Member’s uniform and left in place for an entire multiday training exercise.\r\n\r\nHigh-level blast exposures that are potentially concussive (i.e. > 180 dB) are more difficult to measure, but the DoD has made a huge investment in the development of wearable blast gauges that can be attached to the helmet or uniform of a Service Member and maintain a count of the number of exposures that occur over a period lasting multiple weeks or even months.\r\n\r\nThe current gap in measurement systems is in the intermediate range of impulse noises with peak levels between 140 and 180 dB. These impulses are intense enough to saturate the microphones of conventional noise dosimeters, which are unreliable for measuring peak levels above 140 dB. But those levels are not high enough to trigger most current blast gauges, which cannot register impulse noises below 170 dB. A further complication is that Service Members may potentially be exposed to hundreds or even thousands of mid-level impulse noises in a single training session This means that a mid-level impulse noise monitoring system will require much more sophisticated data handling than a blast gauge that may only need to record the five loudest exposures in a two month period.   \r\n\r\nAt present, mid-level impulse noise exposures can only be recorded with relatively fragile and expensive test measurement equipment that has to be set up and analyzed by expert personnel, who are often researchers rather than occupational hygienists or safety personnel. The immediate need is a test measurement system that is---\r\n\r\na) Portable and rugged enough to be worn on the body by a Service Members in operational training environments;\r\n\r\nb) At a minimum, capable of measuring impulses in the range from 140 dB to 174 dB, with a desired dynamic range from 120 dB to 184 dB.   \r\n\r\nc) Capable of providing an immediate report of the number and intensity of the impulse noise exposures experienced by a Service Member over a single 8-12 hour training exercise;\r\n\r\nd) Simple enough to be used by safety personnel who do not have specific expertise in impulse noise exposure.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The contractor will develop and demonstrate a prototype system that is---\r\n\r\na) Rugged and compact enough to be worn on the body during operational training. Mechanical characteristics of acceptable field-tested noise dosimeters are listed below.\r\n\r\n1. Dimensions: 5 in. x 2.7 in. x 1.5 in \r\n\r\n2. Weight: 14 oz\r\n\r\nb) Capable of recording all impulse noise events in the range from 140 dB (minimum-182 dB. Data and settings should be stored in nonvolatile memory.\r\n\r\nc) Capable of running continuously for a minimum of an 8 hour period.\r\n\r\nd) Capable of downloading data and generating a report to include:\r\n\r\n1. The number of impulses \r\n\r\n2. The magnitude of each impulse\r\n\r\n3. The A and B durations of each impulse\r\n\r\nThe prototype system should be compared to laboratory grade impulse noise equipment when exposed to controlled impulsive noises from sources such as cold gas shock tubes, arc gap generators, or small arms fired from fixed positions.   Ideally, the prototype system should be able to match the gold-standard systems within +/- 2 dB for impulses within the dynamic range of the system.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The contractor will build and deliver 10 prototype systems meeting the Phase I specifications.   These prototypes will be evaluated by occupational hygiene professionals to assess their usability and suitability for impulse noise monitoring. Prototypes at this stage should be usable during military training operations by personnel who do not have specific expertise in impulse noise exposure. Criteria evaluated will include size, weight, durability, and user friendliness (both in affixing the system to personnel for monitoring and in downloading/reviewing the resulting exposure data).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 10 prototypes, the contractor will provide advanced software which generates a report that includes the following risk analyses, in accordance with requirements laid out in MIL-STD-1474E. The report should include Phase I (d) and, \r\n\r\n1. AHAAH unwarned (the warned reflex has been widely repudiated as not reliably protective); \r\n\r\n2. LAeq 8 Hr; and,\r\n\r\n3. LAeq 100 ms\r\n\r\nThis software should be evaluated by occupational hygienists and safety personnel without impulse noise measurement experience, and will be judged based on user friendliness in downloading, reviewing, and organizing the resulting data.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: In Phase III, the contractor will focus on manufacturing, sustaining, and refining the noise dosimeter and software systems. Both the Army and Navy Public Health Centers have requirements to monitor occupational noise exposure and have hearing conservation programs that focus on noise hazard identification, hearing protection, and monitoring audiometry. Thus, these intermediate-level impulse noise dosimeters and its associated software systems would be well suited for Government use. These Public Health Centers, as well as installation safety and occupational hygienists, are examples of potential government customers that are interested in acquiring this type of technology. Additional customers for these products may include police departments to monitor for noise exposure during firearms training, and other occupational hygienists and safety professionals which monitor processes with impact or impulse noise such as mining, hammer forging in manufacturing sector, and jackhammering and pneumatic nail gun use the construction industry as examples.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMeinke, D., Flamme, G., Murphy, W., Finan, D., Stewart, M., Tasko, S., and Lankford, J.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a preventive technology to reduce the risk of brain injury from blast that is relevant to operational and/or training settings. The technology developed should be portable, light-weight and have low footprint without additional burden/impedance to Warfighter operations/duties and comfort. The end-product should be easily worn/carried by the Warfighter and the device can be an active or passive system in nature.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Injury to brain from blast related trauma has been a critical problem for Warfighter brain health and performance (e.g. traumatic brain injury). Although the current personal protective equipment, up to an extent, is designed to protect against shrapnel and projectiles from explosive events and low caliber ammunition, there is still risk stemming from the blast overexposure and technologies that provide protection/prevention against blast are highly desirable. The need to accelerate and develop these types of technologies, which can work as an either active/passive systems, has been further realized from the numerous traumatic brain injuries experienced by US forces following recent bombing of Ain al-Asad air base attack by adversaries (Military times, Feb 10, 2020). There is a likelihood that these issues could be further complicated due the new requirement of Maneuverability Center of Excellence to develop lighter weight personnel protective equipment to meet the demands of the Warfighter in future multi-domain operations 2028 (MDO). Unfortunately, there are no preventative technologies to reduce the risk of Warfighters’ brain health during combat and training operations. (Pratt NJ., 2017; Review of Department of Defense Test Protocols for Combat Helmets, 2014). Potentially injurious mechanical forces of blast include, but are not limited to, overpressure, accelerative forces, and impact forces on the subject from dislodging. Technologies that can mitigate the risk of injury by triggering preventive mechanisms from these forces associated with blast such as overpressure and/or impact are highly desired. Blast overpressure is in the order of nanoseconds for initial peak rise time with a total event time-scale less than 5-6 milliseconds for improvised explosive device (IED). This is a near instantaneous environmental exposures, thus any innovative technology should quickly respond to mitigate injury. Non-invasive innovative technologies that can either protect the brain by reducing the loading forces of blast or biologically insulating the brain from overpressure/accelerative forces for impact (secondary/tertiary blast) are highly desirable. The medical system or technology is highly desirable to integrate on to the Warfighter without compromising the performance of the individual and the other technologies/systems (e.g. GPS or communication equipment) carried by the Warfighter. The medical system or technology should be non-invasive, safe, wearable, non-pharmaceutical/nutraceutical, portable, light-weight, and user-friendly that can trigger physiological responses to make brain less susceptible to injury from the mechanical forces of blast. The medical system or protective technology is desired (but not required in Phase I) to perform well under field rugged conditions such as extreme temperatures, humidity and dust/wet conditions. Overall, this topic desires to develop/identify a technology and/or a medical system to mitigate the risk of blast related traumatic brain injury that can be accelerated towards fieldable use.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: To develop/demonstrate the feasibility of the prototype under limited blast loading conditions (e.g. overpressure) to identify viable functionalities (activation/trigger of sensing systems) of the prototype. Blast loading conditions simulation should replicate ecologically valid “free-field” blast exposures from an IED-like blast exposure. WRAIR has an advanced blast simulator and the performer may coordinate with WRAIR to leverage blast simulation capabilities for prototype feasibility demonstration. A demonstration will be achieved by subjecting the prototypes to dynamic loading of blast overpressure exposure at different pressures (e.g. 4psi – 24 psi in steps of 4psi). At the end of the phase, a working prototype/device should demonstrate the feasibility/application of the system by providing a road-map or experimental plan for pre-clinical testing to test the efficacy of the system in laboratory setting. No animal and/or human studies are required during this phase.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: An iterative process can be used to develop a prototype by sensing blast or blunt trauma and activating of the medical/preventive system against a biological organism (e.g. use of animal models). Blast and animal research capabilities at WRAIR may be leveraged to test the efficacy of the prototype. Consideration should be given to large animal models for prototype testing that may include pig, sheep, or non-human primates. Prototype should not significantly burden the soldier with weight and should be comfortable to wear. Prototype should be easy to use and operate. In addition, it should not interfere with any communication system used by the Warfighter. The efficacy of the technology requires testing in a pre-clinical setting against a wide range of blast overpressures (primary blast) and/or blast overpressure + impact scenario (tertiary blast). The technology should demonstrate protective-ness against blast related traumatic injury under the testing conditions in the laboratory. The prototype effectiveness can be shown through the assessment of injury reduction (e.g. reduction in brain hemorrhage, lesions, axonal injury and/or inflammation). Technology should also demonstrate that the prototype (s) can withstand the field rugged conditions such as extreme temperature, humidity and/or dry/wet environments in the laboratory. At the end of this phase, the prototype should demonstrate a clear path to show efficacy in pre-clinical testing and future readiness for testing in scaled human conditions to show the protectiveness of the product. An FDA regulatory plan will be provided during Phase II to illustrate the technology’s pathway as a medical device to protect against blast related traumatic brain injuries.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The performer should refine and implement their regulatory strategy for obtaining FDA approval (if necessary) based on the initial feedback from FDA (if necessary). The prototypes developed should provide protective efficacy and operational viability on Warfighters in the blast conditions where blast-induced performance deficits are expected/identified (e.g. breaching training) or conduct clinical trials to conclusive demonstrate protective capabilities of the product. The performer may coordinate with WRAIR/USAMRDC/USAMMDA for this objective for advanced development. The performer can seek additional funding from other government sources and/or private investors to commercialize the project. Plans for large-scale production, licensing and process for rapid deployment of devices without compromising the efficiency of the product are sought through the funding from government sources and/or private organizations. This technology can be used to prevent impact TBI that can occur in civilian populations such as sports concussive, blast exposure in law enforcement personnel, and bicycle/motorcycle accidents.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPrat NJ, Daban JL, Voiglio EJ, Rongieras F.

"topic_title": "Underwater Blast Lung Computational Model",
"branch": "Defense Health Program",
"topic_number": "DHA211-003",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this SBIR is to develop a computational model of the human lung as it responds to underwater blast insult in order to predict injury in explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel exposed to underwater explosion (UNDEX). To meet this objective, a finite element model (FEM) that accepts UNDEX metrics and outputs lung physiological response and/or injury from the blast insult will be developed. Development of the underwater blast lung model will improve existing injury predictions and provide actionable injury assessment to mission planners as they evaluate operational risk management.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: FEM is a valuable tool in a number of industries (e.g. automobile) for predicting human injury to a variety of traumas. The Department of Defense (DoD) has sponsored the development of computational models that predict how the human body will respond to in-air blast insult. The focus of this SBIR is to identify a software modeling approach that can characterize the physiological response of human lungs to underwater blast insult. The model must be able to compensate for the lungs being under hydrostatic pressure (up to 200 ft seawater) for divers operating on scuba equipment.  In addition, the interactions between the blast wave and lung response with the surrounding bone, muscle, and tissue in and around the thoracic cavity needs to be incorporated into the model. As divers may be using different gas mixes other than air (e.g. heliox, tri-mix), incorporation of this variable would be highly valuable, but is not mandatory. This model will provide predictive physiological responses to underwater blast to improve risk modeling for establishing safe standoff distances for EOD divers working around explosives. \r\n\r\nThe software models developed by this SBIR can be marketed for use by the DoD and other communities, who have divers working with explosives or other impulsive noise sources (e.g. seismic airguns, pile driving, underwater construction tools). Early adopters of the software modeling products from this SBIR may include surface and undersea warfare operators and undersea construction and salvage crews. In addition, these models would also be valuable to environmental protection groups within the DoD as well as industry for use in predicting injury to marine mammals and other aquatic life. Companies have had success being able to commercialize high fidelity human anatomy models for the scientific community.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: In Phase I, researchers will identify the physical modelling requirements and physics that must be solved related to the properties of the model. Researchers will identify an appropriate code base that is suitable for solving the response physics. A simple model (e.g. lung-sized sphere) will be created that responds appropriately to the underwater blast physical properties. Model outputs shall be validated against theoretical predictions or experimental data. The physiological variables that will need to be incorporated into the model to transition from the simple spherical model to an anatomically correct version of the model shall be characterized. The performance and capabilities of the final model for Phase I will be demonstrated. Finally, researchers will identify the recommended approaches that will be used in Phase II. These approaches will be identified in consultation with the COR and subject matter experts.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: In Phase II, the model will be made more complex by transitioning to an anatomically-correct lung shape and incorporating specific tissue and material properties of the lungs and surrounding tissues. Specifically, an upper torso model shall be created that incorporates bone, soft tissue, lungs, and diaphragm at sizes accurate to a 50th percentile male. As with Phase I, this model should respond appropriately to the UNDEX physical properties. The model outputs shall be compared to experimental data from physical models to be provided by the COR. Each of the tissue layers should show a response to the underwater blast insult. However, the interactions between tissues, being much more complex can be planned for Phase III.  The Phase II model and data will be demonstrated and delivered to the COR for further evaluation and analysis.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  In Phase III, a complete underwater blast lung and thorax computational model will be developed.  This will include high fidelity anatomical structures as well as the interactions between all structures (e.g. lungs interaction with rib cage; diaphragm interaction with lungs). The model should be able to respond to a variety of UNDEX scenarios including explosives with different charge weight, explosive type, and location of explosive relative to lungs in water column. Also, the model should incorporate lungs at different depths and orientations in water column, as well as with the lungs at different inflation volumes (e.g. due to inhalation/exhalation). The Completed model and data will be delivered to the sponsor for further evaluation and analysis. Additional Phase III follow-on work may include extending the modeling techniques to marine mammals or diving birds. \r\n\r\nThis model will provide immediate value for DoD entities such as Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head and the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, who support the development of safe standoff requirements for divers operating around underwater explosives. The Army Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) could potentially want to integrate this model into their simulation platforms. Additional non-DoD customers that this model could be marketed to would be industries that employ divers for explosive work, construction, and other infrastructures in which divers are subjected to high energy underwater sources such as explosives, pile driving, or seismics. Numerous companies have developed high fidelity human models that are available for commercial use (e.g. Zygote, Biodigital, 3D4Medical). There is a strong potential of interest from academia and scientific institutes for evaluating effects on animal models (i.e. diving birds, marine mammals). Joint Program Committee (JPC)-1 has also expressed an interest in tracking the model’s development towards a completed product to evaluate its potential as a training component [5].\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRichmond, D.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Demonstrate technology for automatic association of environmental conditions and activities with chemical and physical exposures based on feedback from body worn and area monitors to augment health risk assessments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The collection of context-sensitive metadata during health risk assessments is critical to understand the circumstances that are associated with exposures and health outcomes. In a traditional occupational environment, an industrial hygienist or technician manually observes and logs events and work activities that are associated with exposure levels of concern. By automating the identification of activity and environmental conditions using feedback from body worn and area sensor systems and leveraging the internet-of things, the industrial hygienist can more readily provide specific feedback to workers to mitigate potentially hazardous exposure conditions. Further, context-sensitive data can be used to augment existing DoD environmental and biomonitoring programs, such as the Joint Health Risk Management (JHRM) program and the Army’s Health Readiness and Performance System (HRAPS). Activity data of interest include specific information about operational tasks, including operation of specific machinery in a maintenance shop, or various actions associated with flight line maintenance, such as pre-flight checks and refueling actions. Environmental data of interest include information such as indoors versus outdoors, local ventilation conditions and weather. Chemical and physical exposures of interest include particulate matter, total volatile organic compounds, ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, noise, and heat/cold stress. The algorithm and integration hardware should be designed to incorporate data from commercial off-the-shelf sensors, such as MultiRAE gas monitors (present at most military bases), standard noise dosimeters, weather monitors, smart wearable technologies (e.g. smart watches, smartphones), as well as next generation sensor technologies currently in development. The final algorithm and associated integration hardware must store logged data locally, incorporate a user-interface, and operate for at least 10 hours on battery power. The device will also incorporate user-configurable alarm settings and an option for the user to provide feedback to the device regarding notable activities. The data should be exportable in formats compatible with DoD environmental and biomonitoring programs.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: During the phase I effort, a prototype system will be developed to demonstrate the technical feasibility for an algorithm and interface for context-sensitive environmental monitoring. The algorithm and associated integration hardware will be demonstrated for its ability to automatically identify maintenance-related tasks, such as painting, stripping, and sanding, completed in a controlled environment (e.g. laboratory or shop), as well as simple environmental conditions, such as indoors versus outdoors and location. An interface will be designed where the worker being monitored can provide feedback to train the algorithm and contextual information can be provided back to worker.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During the phase II effort, a robust system will be demonstrated that is capable of automatically and accurately identifying specific work tasks, such as welding, drilling, sanding, stripping, and painting, as well as basic environmental conditions, in a military field environment. The government will provide parameters for metadata needed. The 711th Human Performance Wing will test the prototype independently during this effort and provide feedback back to the small business in order to accelerate the development of a product that is practical to transition to an operational environment.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The context-sensitive sensor system should demonstrate connectivity with DoD programs, such as the Army’s Health Readiness and Performance System (HRAPS), Joint Health Risk Management (JHRM) program, and other comparable systems. In addition to providing value to the DoD, context-sensitive technology capable of automatically associating environmental conditions and activities with chemical and physical exposures would be valuable to industrial hygienists working in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance industries where workplace exposures require consistent monitoring to ensure health and safety of workers. The final product will be relevant for research applications where activities and locations linked with exposure levels could be associated with epigenetic markers or chronic health outcomes, such as noise-induced hearing loss, heart disease, and cancer.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFung AG, Rajapakse MY, McCartney MM, Falcon AK, Fabia FM, Kenyon NJ, Davis CE. 2019.

"topic_title": "Wearable Radio Frequency Weapon Exposure Detector",
"branch": "Defense Health Program",
"topic_number": "DHA211-005",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR); Directed Energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical; Sensors\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a low cost, low weight, small size wearable radio frequency (RF) weapon exposure detector.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Directed energy weapons, including radio frequency (RF) weapons, are a growing threat on the battlefield. Determinants of RF weapon antipersonnel effects are multifactorial and RF injuries will be situation dependent and very hard to predict.  Without known patterns of RF injury to guide diagnosis, it will be difficult to differentiate RF injury from other common sources of illness and injury such as heat stroke. This ambiguous symptomology is aggravated by the transient nature of RF energy.  Without a sensor it is possible that no residual evidence of RF attack will be available.  A wearable RF detector to signal and document exposure to injurious levels of RF energy will allow personnel to take timely and appropriate protective measures, enable confident diagnoses of RF exposure injury, and serve as a critical intelligence resource for defining current battlefield threats.  However, to be useful, the wearable RF weapon exposure detector must, in order of importance, have an extremely small footprint in terms of space, weight and power (SWaP), be very low cost, have a very low false positive rate, and be easy to interpret.  The topic does not seek a replacement for sophisticated instruments used for measuring occupational hazards. This RF detector concept is analogous to passive M8 and M9 paper used in the detection of chemical weapon hazards.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Analyze RF bioeffects in relation to common US and ally military RF equipment and potential enemy weapon system emission levels and frequencies.  The spectrum of interest includes IEEE UHF through Ka bands. Determine optimal detector threshold sensitivity for signaling immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) exposure while minimizing false positives. Because irradiance levels needed to injure personnel are orders of magnitude higher than required to damage electronics, designing a broad band absorber with appropriate response characteristic will require substantial innovation.   Integration of an antenna into an affordable system which will survive in the extreme irradiance environment is a significant challenge, therefore the offeror may need to identify novel broad band RF detection materials and alarm/signaling mechanisms.  Design a low cost, low SWaP, low false positive, easily readable, wearable RF weapon exposure detector that can widely distributed on the battlefield.  An unobtrusive wearable detector would be smaller than a M4 magazine pouch and attach to a tactical vest by the Pouch Attachment Ladder System/MOLLE mount.  High cost, high complexity sensors are not desired for this solicitation.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and test sensor components. Model expected system performance from component testing. Integrate components into breadboard/brassboard level prototype and compare measured performance against modeled predictions.  Review non-open source information regarding military RF systems and RF bioeffects provided by government. Refine design and build production representative prototypes and validate detection performance in laboratory environment. Provide prototypes for operational utility evaluations. Conduct environmental testing.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: If there is a proliferation of RF weapons, it is expected that a Wearable RF Weapon Detector will be generally useful for a wide variety of military operations.  In Phase III the contractor will work with a program office, such as the Air Force Medical Readiness Agency’s Advanced Development Office or PEO Soldiers’ Program Manager for Soldier Survivability to finalize the detector as a military product.    Desired end state would be to establish the Wearable RF Weapon Detector as a standard military equipment supply item distributed through Defense Logistics Agency.   Additional commercial applications include medical, industrial, manufacturing, and test facilities in which personnel may be inadvertently exposed to high power RF sources.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tVecchia, P. et al.

"topic_number": "DHA211-006",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a portable, customizable, computerized dynamic balance and measurement system that allows programmable levels of instability to deliver accurate Sensory Organization Tests in clinic, home, or field environments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) account for a significant proportion of limited duty days and nondeployable classification in military service members1,2. TBI and MSKI both cause short-term disability, but can have lasting consequences such as loss of strength and motor control, chronic pain, cognitive deficits, and permanent neurological damage. Postural stability is the ability to control center of mass (COM) in relation to an individual’s base of support and requires integration of an individual’s visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems. Balance training is used to improve postural stability after injury and must target all three systems for optimal effectiveness. Currently, the most common form of balance testing and training in clinics uses a balance board or stability ball to create an unstable surface to train the somatosensory system. More recent efforts have engaged the visual system by integrating virtual reality (VR) with static force measurement platforms to assess COM motion in various VR environments. While integrated VR systems have expanded the types of visual and vestibular perturbations available, use of a static force platform means the motor control system is not challenged or perturbed in a controlled manor. Systems with dynamic platforms would be beneficial for assessment and rehabilitation from vestibular and musculoskeletal injuries.\r\n\r\nMore traditional balance testing systems incorporate programmable moving platforms capable of perturbing and measuring COM movement (e.g. computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) systems) in a systematic and measurable way. Their ability to concurrently or independently manipulate the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems make them an invaluable tool for delivering an objective Sensory Organization Test (SOT), which can help the clinician to determine if therapy is needed and which sensory system to focus on. Indeed, a large amount of normative and clinical SOT data exists for military personnel across various branches5. Though considered the gold standard for vestibular physical therapy assessments, the utility of current CDP systems are undermined because of their large size, high cost, and limited functionality (i.e. pre-programmed tests for evaluation only, not modifiable for targeted training), and thus are usually found only in large medical centers and specialty clinics.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this SBIR is to develop a product that maintains the strengths of traditional CDP systems, but that takes advantage of the developments in portable balance measurement devices and portable display technology (e.g. VR), thereby creating a lower cost and portable balance assessment and training system. Currently, there are no commercially available portable platforms that combine COM measurements with computerized dynamic control of platform stability; these are essential for conducting SOTs and targeted training. The development of such a platform in conjunction with VR, or similar technology, can be used to not only provide balance perturbations seen in SOTs (i.e. a sway referenced support surface) but also provide graded training that can be used during post-TBI rehabilitation or to mimic a specific dynamic environment for physical training purposes. The purpose of this SBIR is to create a portable, computerized dynamic balance and measurement system.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: In Phase I, the performer will first define specifications for the device that must be met to deliver physical perturbations used in standard SOTs. This includes the platform’s maximum/minimum tilt angles, speed of tilt changes, speed at which data must be streamed (input and output frequencies), platform weight limits, and COM measurement accuracy. The mechanism (e.g.  springs, balls, actuators) of inducing instability at various tilt levels should be established. Although no defined standards need to be met for the following aspects of the system, specifications such as platform translation, and the number and increment of instability levels should be pre-determined by the performer. \r\n\r\nTo be effective, the device should be able to:\r\n\r\n1) Be portable (weight, size) such that only a power source, computer, and VR headset (or similar portable display system) is required for additional setup. \r\n\r\n2) Include a portable platform capable of controllable tilt in at least two axes (minimum ± 20⁰ in each axes).  \r\n\r\n3) Provide controllable instability (or fluctuation) at all levels of tilt.\r\n\r\n4) Collect and stream accurate and reliable COM and platform movement data to a computer.\r\n\r\n5) Stream platform data to a development platform (e.g. Unity), for integration within custom gaming applications.\r\n\r\n6) Integrate with software, capable of controlling the platform’s movement and instability levels and collecting data.  \r\n\r\n7) Allow for easy administration of the SOT and instant test results to the clinician. \r\n\r\nAn initial proof-of-concept design will be developed to demonstrate that the product is able to meet minimum functional capability. The design will include the device’s basic architecture and components. While creating this proof-of-concept design, the performer must keep in mind the potential customer’s settings. The technology should be designed for use, at minimum, in a research or clinical setting (i.e. require minimal setup and an easy software user-interface), with potential setup capacity for in-home therapy or field-based setups. Additionally, the dynamic response of the proposed device should be mathematically outlined and numerically simulated, showing the limits and expected response of the device in terms of user mass, platform acceleration, and deflection angle. A working prototype of the physical design is preferred to demonstrate eventual full system capabilities.\r\n\r\nTogether, Phase I deliverables include: \r\n\r\n1) Design and use specifications that the proposed device should meet. \r\n\r\n2) CAD model and system integration diagrams of proposed device. \r\n\r\n3) Mathematical representation and numerical simulations demonstrating ability to provide varying levels of tilt and instability in different use cases (e.g. body mass of user) including those of the SOT testing conditions.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: In Phase II, the performer will construct and test a prototype balance training system based on requirements from the original solicitation and specifications identified in Phase I. The performer must validate the accuracy and precision of COM measurements, tilt angles, and instability levels under varying conditions (e.g. amount of platform instability, user mass, etc). As stated above, traditional CDP systems are not portable and typically require a dedicated space of ~25-30 ft2. One of the improvements of the current development is that it should only require a power source, computer, and a flat surface ~4-9 ft2. As such, the performer will demonstrate that the system is portable and can be used in a variety of settings, while providing accurate measurements. An initial FDA regulatory plan should be provided if applicable. Finally, in Phase II, the performer will also develop the software that accompanies the physical device. The software should be capable of defining and controlling tilt angles and instability levels. It should also provide real-time visualization of COM movement and platform tilt angles. \r\n\r\nA software application should be designed to showcase the system’s ability to stream COM movement and tilt angles for integration with a virtual environment within acceptable delay times. An application should also be designed that will deliver the SOT, collect accurate COM information, and provide composite measurement results as well as individual scores for each of the SOT conditions.\r\n\r\nPhase II deliverables include:\r\n\r\n1. The physical working prototype balance platform capable of varying levels of tilt and instability.\r\n\r\n2. Instruction manual for setup and usage. \r\n\r\n3. Accompanying software that allows the user to connect a computer (wired or wirelessly) for data streaming and visualization. \r\n\r\n4. Demonstrative software application, compatible with gaming/development platforms that support major VR devices in the current market. \r\n\r\n5. Software infrastructure (SDK) that can be used to stream data into custom VR applications. \r\n\r\n6. Specifications document that details limitations of the device (e.g. user weight, tilt levels, life-time, etc.). \r\n\r\n7. Application that delivers the SOT and provides composite and individual condition scores.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase II end-product is a well-designed, portable balance training and testing system for use in research or clinical settings that is able to deliver the SOT with the same standards of commercially available dynamic posturography systems. To move this SBIR work towards operational- and commercial-readiness, Phase III efforts should focus on validating the device’s repeatability and reliability against current devices used for SOT in targeted populations and further development for clinical use (production, delivery/setup, software, durability). This will support future commercialization efforts in both military and civilian markets. It is anticipated that DoD customers will include clinical rehabilitation settings that address TBI diagnosis and symptom treatment (vestibular dysfunction, dizziness, oculomotor system dysfunction) and clinics for MSKI injuries (chronic ankle instability, knee/ankle injury, ligament injury). Key customers may include facilities that currently own CDP systems, including large military treatment facilities (e.g. Naval Medical Center San Diego, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center), Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals (e.g. Palo Alto, Minneapolis, Seattle), and academic universities (e.g. University of Wisconsin system, University of California System, University of Pittsburgh). Additionally, a portable and lower-cost system would enable medical facilities to purchase and use more than one balance system in different clinics. It would also enable access to objective assessment and rehabilitation tools at military clinics (e.g. Twentynine Palms) and civilian outpatient clinics.  A successful device could also have implications for use in deployed settings if ruggedized. Commercial markets that could benefit from this novel product would include: private rehabilitation centers, sports training centers, and research organizations.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDefense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC).

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To provide a radioprotector medical countermeasure (MCM) to the Joint Force with effective prophylactics to recover from and survive Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) resulting from ionizing radiation exposure. In concert with resuscitative intervention and supportive care, MCMs would improve survival and reduce recovery times for the individual contributing to a higher level of unit readiness.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The current Joint Force requires Medical Counter Measures (MCMs) against threats to sustain the full range of military operations.  The Joint Force must effectively protect the maximum number of personnel against the greatest number of hazards as far forward as possible, and sustain the casualty from the point of exposure to the point of definitive care.  These MCMs will be administered at the lowest echelon of health care possible.  They will work in concert with other medical products to lessen performance degradation and increase survival for the individual contributing to a higher level of unit readiness.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense requires MCMs for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) that are safe and effective prophylaxes and therapeutics.  To be effective, any prophylaxes must be available to Joint Force personnel prior to ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. It will reduce the likelihood of developing severe adverse health effects associated with ARS to increase survival. Prophylaxes would be administered to the Joint Force prior to operating in a known, high risk Ionizing Radiation (IR) environment.\r\n\r\nARS encompasses a spectrum of pathophysiologic changes caused by exposure to high doses of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period. Injuries sustained depend on the dose and extent of radiation exposure (e.g., whole- or partial-body). Radiation exposures exceeding 2 Gray (Gy) in adults can result in the depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and cellular progenitors in the bone marrow, which may lead to severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and death from infection or hemorrhage. Higher radiation doses can cause gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including mucosal barrier breakdown, bacterial translocation, and loss of GI structural integrity, which can lead to rapid death. Individuals who survive ARS may suffer from the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), which can include pulmonary, renal, cardiovascular, immunological, and cutaneous complications occurring weeks to months after radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nThere are three FDA-approved post-exposure therapeutic drugs to treat the hematopoietic subsyndrome of ARS.  There are no FDA-approved prophylactic MCMs for IR exposures resulting in ARS.  Future pharmaceuticals will be used in concert with the most appropriate and cost effective mix of existing protocols for treating radiation injuries and could be used at any role of care.  Together, future pharmaceuticals and existing medical management protocols (e.g., supportive care, antioxidants, antiemetics, antibiotics, colony stimulating factors, blood/bone marrow transplants, isolation) will provide the means to effectively treat the maximum number of personnel.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this effort, the terms “MCM(s)” and “drug(s)” will include drugs, biologics, and cellular therapies. The objective of a prophylactic MCM is to reduce the likelihood of developing severe adverse health effects associated with ARS to increase survival. The prophylactic MCM must work in concert with other medical products to lessen performance degradation and increase survival for an individual contributing to a higher level of unit readiness. A prophylactic MCM will need to be given pre-exposure, pre-symptomatic and be administered at the lowest echelon of heath care possible to the Joint Force (age range of 18 - 62 years) prior to operating in a known, high risk irradiated environment. To achieve this effect the method of administration must be tailored to optimize ease of administration in an operational environment.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Offerors must propose proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of proposed ARS prophylactic MCM against a relevant susceptible cell populations such as hematopoietic progenitors. Demonstration of efficacy in some form of an in vivo model is also acceptable, but not required for Phase I. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, drugs, but can include biologics or cellular therapies.  Exit criteria for successful completion of Phase I research would be the demonstration of efficacy at the LD70/30 or greater radiation dose levels.  The LD70/30 represents a radiation dose that would result in 70% mortality over 30 days in vehicle treated mice. Information garnered from Phase I experiments may be more qualitative than quantitative.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: With successful completion of Phase I experiments, Phase II would further evaluate the medical countermeasure (MCM) in a small animal study.  A Phase II effort will test effective prophylactic ARS MCMs at the LD70/30 dose level or greater in an appropriate animal model.  In these studies, the MCM would be administered to animals prior to radiation exposure.  The animal model should be of sufficient size and scope to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in survival in animals receiving the MCM. The SBIR Phase II studies shall include experiments of a manner that facilitates the collection of non-clinical GLP pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The PK and PD information will be of paramount importance to inform subsequent Phase III studies.  Optimized formulation studies involving development of a preparation of the drug should be conducted during this phase II effort.  Responders to this SBIR should provide a test plan for in vivo evaluation prior to the start of Phase II studies. An initial FDA regulatory plan will be provided in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III studies would further refine the animal model and the compound/drug dosing regimen. The goal would be to work toward FDA approval of a MCM for one or more radioprotector MCMs against ARS. The studies in Phase III should support FDA approval/ licensure to include entry into clinical studies, cGMP manufacturing scale up, and pivotal efficacy studies. FDA licensure/approval is not necessary for the project to be deemed successful. One means for the offeror to document progress is through a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) of the technology using the harmonized Quantitative Technology Readiness Level (QTRL) guidance document as described by the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). A second means for demonstrating success is the establishment of funding and partnering with commercial companies (if necessary) to facilitate bringing the product to market, as resulting products may be applicable to various medical (e.g. oncology) or technical fields.  A third potential course for Phase III development would be potential transition to advanced product development by JPEO-CBRND, subject to JPEO funding priorities at the time of transition.\r\n\r\nSuccessful radioprotector MCM products directed against ARS will clearly have use by other government agencies, hospitals/ emergency departments, first responders, and others providing responses to nuclear and radiation dispersal incidents.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRosen E, Day R and Singh V.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Development of a small molecule, antibacterial drug candidate for the treatment of service members in the Military Health System infected by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa to include in vitro and in vivo efficacy in models of wounds, burns, sepsis and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Successful treatment and recovery of service members/warfighters wounded in the line of duty is frequently complicated by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. In the best medical evacuation systems spanning the past 18 years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. troops injured in combat and moved to higher echelons of care were still at a high risk of developing post-injury infections. Wound infections can develop days following injury and are largely attributed to Gram-negative organisms acquired in the hospital setting (1).  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most frequent causes of wound infections and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. A 2017 surveillance summary of P. aeruginosa infections in military treatment facilities reported 47.9% of P. aeruginosa infections were healthcare-associated cases and that none of the strains tested displayed 100% susceptibility to any antibiotic tested (2).\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, patients on mechanical ventilation due to the disease can become coinfected with hospital-acquired P. aeruginosa strains leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is estimated to occur in 9-27% of all mechanically-ventilated patients (3), and colonization by hospital-acquired MDR strains carries a mortality rate up to 60% (4). Given the morbidity and mortality rates associated with drug-resistant infections of P. aeruginosa the desired output of this project will be a novel chemical matter prototype for further preclinical development, with utility to treat antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa in wounds, traumatic injury, sepsis and/or VAP.\r\n\r\nThe development of an oral, injectable, and/or topical, small molecule therapeutic agent for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections in service members will provide a valuable therapeutic addition to the current standard-of-care in the Military Health System.  The desired product will have efficacy against clinically-relevant, MDR strains of P. aeruginosa.  The product will demonstrate effectiveness in in vivo bacterial infection models (e.g., thigh, wound, pneumonia, burn, trauma, sepsis). Activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms and/or antibacterial coverage of other priority pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae is desirable, but not required.  Corresponding in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity profiles must be both developmentally and clinically acceptable for oral, injectable, and/or topical administration.  Prototype compounds may include small molecules, peptidomimetics (both up to MW 1000), or peptides (up to MW 2000).  We will not accept proposals for antibody, bacteriophage, nor vaccine solutions.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will center on defining a set of small molecules that are effective at inhibiting in vitro growth of MDR P. aeruginosa strains at low toxicity. The awardee should be able to demonstrate that the selected molecules perform similarly or better in vitro to current standard of care antibiotics in the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections. Required Phase I deliverables will include 1) a practical chemical synthesis of small molecule antibiotic candidate compounds amenable to scale-up; 2) demonstration of in vitro efficacy against military-relevant, MDR strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to include minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs); and 3) assessment of in vitro toxicity in relevant cell lines.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Required Phase II deliverables will include 1) demonstration of in vivo efficacy equivalent or superior to current standard-of-care against military-relevant, MDR strains of P. aeruginosa in validated, clinically-relevant models of wounds, burns, sepsis and/or VAP. In vivo models must include at least one clinically-relevant, higher order animal species model of wounds, pneumonia, burns and/or sepsis for one of the small molecule solutions which successfully completed Phase I of this SBIR. Porcine models of wound infection, sepsis (peritonitis or intravascular infusion of live bacteria), and/or VAP is preferable, but any clinically-relevant models of these indications would be acceptable; 2) demonstration of safe and clinically-acceptable in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles; 3) demonstration of an acceptable resistance profile following standard protocols; 4) demonstration of safety in acute toxicity and safety pharmacology assessments in a rodent species (non-Good Laboratory Practices [GLP]); 5) a plan for declaration as a preclinical candidate in order to proceed toward the assembly of an investigational new drug (IND) submission package in Phase III; 6) development of a safe, scalable, reproducible synthesis of the small molecule antibiotic candidate compound; and 7) development of a safe and clinically-acceptable formulation for the intended route of administration of said small molecule solution. An initial FDA regulatory plan should be submitted during Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The vision or end state for this product is FDA approval as a small molecule therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with wounds and/or burns infected with MDR P. aeruginosa.  Additionally, the product may also or alternatively be approved for the treatment of VAP and/or sepsis.  Phase III will require the completion of a preclinical data package, to include preclinical toxicity assessment in a higher order species following Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), for inclusion in an investigational new drug (IND) submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to commence clinical trials.  A possible funding source for these studies and early clinical trials is the Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program (JWMRP) through the Joint Program Committee-2 (JPC-2) under the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP), which offers focused support for early clinical testing of medical solutions.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is an additional potential funding source as its focus is mainly on countermeasures for public health threats.  A viable commercial technology transfer partner would be required to complete the full FDA-approval process.  Potential commercial applications for this product include analogous applications, as mentioned above, in public, medical treatment facilities, as well as potential Gram-negative biothreat indications.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAronson et al.

"topic_number": "DHA211-009",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a lightweight device that generates medical grade oxygen for deployed medical facilities and personnel.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The ability to deliver oxygen to patients requiring supplemental oxygen is an essential capability for deployed medical facilities that provide treatment primarily to combat casualties who incur traumatic injuries. The Army based its current oxygen generating capabilities on the American College of Surgeons trauma treatment guidelines, which recommended that all trauma patients receive oxygen at a rate of at least 10 liters per minute (L/m).1 To meet this high demand for oxygen, the Army developed its current centralized oxygen generating and distribution system that is extremely heavy, maintenance intensive and requires large dedicated generators to operate. These characteristics limit the organizations’ mobility to support combat operations, and are incompatible with the austere, far-forward battlefield anticipated in multi-domain operations. Multiple studies strongly suggest that the actual oxygen requirements for trauma patients is much less that the 15 L/m previously recommended; they indicate that the majority of trauma patients may not need any supplemental oxygen to sustain adequate blood oxygen levels,2,3 and patients with TBI may be significantly harmed by hyperoxia.4 Therefore, the Army plans to replace the current centralized oxygen production and delivery system with a system of individual oxygen generators that are distributed to individual patients throughout the facility. These devices would be lightweight devices that produce oxygen at a variable rate up to 5-6 L/m and would operate on standard 110/220 VAC power with an internal battery back-up that would enable the device to operate up to 4 hours without external power. The outflow of oxygen from two of these devices could be merged (stackable) to provide higher flows of oxygen for the 12-15% of trauma casualties and other patients whose oxygen requirements are above 6 L/m.5\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will consist of designing schematics and diagrams along with limited testing of a prototype for a lightweight oxygen generating device that will produce a 90-95% purity medical grade oxygen at a continuous, variable rate of up to 6 L/m from ambient air. The device will be designed to operate effectively in a deployed setting that will include static, dismounted medical units as well as medical transport vehicles (ground and rotary-wing ambulances). Specific emphasis will be placed on portability, reliability, and design for the particular challenges of the battlefield environment (to include no- or low-light, loud or noise-discipline conditions, cramped space, extreme temperature environments, elevation, etc.) and use by all providers to include the combat medic. While the size, weight, power, and performance constraints will not be as rigid for a Phase I prototype, the ultimate goals for Phase II should be considered and attainable. Long-term need for stacking capability will be considered. Though water has been shown a viable feedstock for oxygen generation, water of adequate purity is a logistical constraint in the prolonged field care environment. However, possible alternative non-liquid feedstocks to transiently supplement the fundamental oxygen delivery capacity of the device are not excluded nor required (any hazardous byproducts must be mitigated). An argument for the approach chosen, to include recognized open questions in the literature, will be included.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: This phase will consist of further development of a portable oxygen generating device demonstrating its utility, and validating the prototype(s) through relevant testing. During the first year, the prototype(s) will be tested in simulated environments (>40oC, <0oC, humidity > 90%, 10,000 ft elevation) in order to determine practical viability. The second year will involve refinement and more rigorous testing of the chosen design in contractor-arranged laboratory studies to determine purity of the oxygen produced and accuracy of flow rates. Testing and refinement will involve the device’s adherence to battlefield constraints; the device must be portable, lightweight (~2 kg), self-contained, have low power requirements (i.e. can operate continuously for 4 hours on a single battery), quiet (<45db), have stacking capability, and perform to all needed parameters concurrently. The phase II commercialization plans should include a regulatory plan for FDA clearance. The contractor would ideally identify appropriate potential commercialization partners (manufacturing, marketing, etc.) to facilitate technology transition.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The technology developed under this SBIR effort will have applicability to both civilian and military emergency medicine; for military application the contractor will coordinate with the US Army Medical Material Development Activity (USAMMDA) Warfighter Expeditionary Medicine and Treatment Office to maximize capability gap mitigation. Phase III will consist of finalizing the device design  and delivering manufactured devices (in their final form) for military-relevant testing such as airworthiness/performance testing (e.g. Joint Enroute Care Equipment Test Standards [JECETS], AR 70-62) and FDA-related testing (e.g. oxygen purity, accuracy of flow rates, etc.) under design freeze. The device will be functional for use by medics, physician assistants, nurses, and physicians in far forward environments (roles 1-3 of care and ambulances). Phase III will also include developing and finalizing training methods and protocols for the new device. In addition, the regulatory package should be in its final form ready for submission to the FDA, including all relevant test data.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAmerican College of Surgeons, and Committee on Trauma.

"topic_number": "DHA211-010",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Development of a platform for DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody delivery in large animal models of HIV infection and a prototype delivery device for use in humans.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: U.S. military personnel are exposed to and impacted by the diverse global HIV epidemic. Despite advances in non-vaccine prevention, the US military experiences a steady epidemic of approximately 350 new HIV infection every year. Effective prevention and therapeutic modalities are of utmost importance in combatting HIV/AIDS in the DoD. The US Military HIV research program (MHRP) is engaged in collaborative research with multiple academic, corporate, and governmental partnerships to develop and test immunologic approaches to prevention and therapy.\r\n\r\nMonoclonal antibodies have great potential for use in prevention and treatment for many infectious diseases including HIV. However, current approaches to monoclonal antibody delivery are limited by price and durability of effect. MHRP seeks to develop innovative ways by which broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be delivered to overcome these challenges. Delivery of gene encoded mAbs by electroporation (EP) is a potential approach. EP has been used in basic research for the past 25 years to aid in the transfer of DNA into cells in vitro. EP in vivo enhances transfer of DNA vaccines and therapeutic plasmids to the skin, muscle, tumors, and other tissues resulting in high levels of expression. EP delivery of vaccines has been demonstrated to induce immune responses in numerous pre-clinical animal models and in human clinical trials for many different infectious diseases and cancer. Delivery of gene-encoded antibodies differs from these active vaccination approaches in that it seeks to minimize immune response to mAb delivery. The method of delivery by using EP technologies and a device capable of delivering selected mAbs will be the desired end product for this effort.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The awardee will demonstrate the scientific, technical, commercial merit and feasibility of a platform technology that relies on delivery of DNA-encoded mAbs. Research could be built upon similar existing technology for other products such as DNA vaccines and therapeutic plasmids.  Phase I will focus on technology conceptualization of DNA-encoded mAbs including performance parameters. The performer will develop rapid methods of delivery of DNA-encoded mAbs. These methods may include the administration of DNA via an intramuscular injection followed by very short electrical pulses (electroporation or EP) that enable the efficient uptake of the DNA by the muscle cells, leading to much higher levels of expression of the delivered genes than with an injection alone.  MAb-encoding DNA should be delivered in a way that minimizes tissue perturbation, avoiding any immune responses and enabling stable, long-term gene expression. Upon completion of Phase I the awardee will have developed, demonstrated and validated the delivery method for DNA-encoded mAbs.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: After successful completion of the Phase I, the awardee will focus on finalizing and refining delivery method and use the results from Phase I studies to optimize the capability of gene encoded mAb technology in small and large animal models. Phase II efforts will focus on developing methods for manufacture of the delivery device for clinical use. The awardee will develop and optimize large animal model for the evaluation of DNA/EP as their musculature permits the evaluation of a human-sized prototype EP device, their larger size and proportionally increased blood volume better mimics what would be observed in humans in terms of dilutional effects of muscle cell-produced mAb. Further the studies should be conducted to demonstrate proof-of-concept that therapeutically relevant serum mAb levels can be achieved in animal models with large blood volumes using human-sized prototype of EP devices.  The awardee will then design a prototype device that will be easy to use in delivering mAbs in clinical settings and/or field testing and ready for transition to manufacturing. The prototype specifications will be defined based on feedback from large animal data to meet the requirements of the delivery system in humans. An initial FDA regulatory plan should be submitted at this stage if appropriate to the product development effort. \r\n\r\nUpon completion of Phase II of this project, the awardee will be able:\r\n\r\n(1) to develop, optimize and manufacture the desired EP device prototype for mAb gene transfer based on Phase I modeling and design. Conduct life cycle and environmental testing with the prototype.\r\n\r\n(2) to develop processes and demonstrate feasibility of a large scale manufacturing of the EP device that can be ready for a future proof-of-concept clinical trial in human volunteers.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected Phase II end-state is qualified, easy to use device to deliver clinically relevant mAbs of interest. The awardee is expected to obtain funding from non-SBIR/STTR government sources and/or the private sector to develop or transition the prototype into a viable FDA-regulated product or service for sale in the military or private sector markets.  The performer will provide data package plan required for application to the FDA after successful large field testing of the assay prototype.\r\n\r\nFor HIV applications, the technology and/or product generated from the Phase III SBIR may be integrated in MHRP’s objective of developing broad spectrum and potent mAbs for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. A potential method of transition for this product will be through the Army futures command following the decision gate process which includes a technology transfer agreement with U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA). In addition, civilian commercialization of this product is likely to include GLP production and GMP manufacture and distribution. \r\n\r\nThe end-state for this product is a commercially viable technology that will be incorporated into the Army’s strategy of developing countermeasures against HIV/AIDS.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tNeumann E, et al.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a container or container system for transporting blood to and throughout the battlefield.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Traumatic hemorrhage remains the leading cause of combat deaths, and rapid resuscitation with blood and/or blood products is necessary to restore volume, maintain hemostasis, and prevent coagulopathy and other morbidities.[1-3] Therefore, blood and blood products must be present at or near the battlefront.[4-7] To facilitate this rapid deployment of blood, inventories must be bolstered through transportation of blood and blood products from donation centers to forward locations. This need is not limited to theaters of war; maintaining blood bank inventories around the globe is critical, but as biologics, these products must be transported with proper cold chain maintenance in containers that can withstand arduous journeys and austere environments and can minimize breakage of storage bags for peak logistical efficiency.[8-11]\r\n\r\nThere are multiple points of potential failure: for instance, after a donation at a blood drive, blood must be packaged and transported to the blood bank where it is required to be tested, processed, and stored until laboratory results are obtained. Then, the blood must be inventoried, packaged, and sent to distribution. It must be maintained cold during shipment overseas (potentially with multiple stops) before receipt and storage at local facilities. Additionally, it must be maintained cold for in-country ground and air shipping to Role of Care 2 or 3 facilities (see [12] for descriptions of Army Roles of Care), at which it must be stored until used or until packaged for carrying by a medic prior to a high risk mission (Role of Care 1). At each step, temperature control is critical if blood is to remain in compliance with established standards; very little variance is allowed. Thus, along with the capability of maintaining these temperatures, a careful record demonstrating the unbroken cold chain is required. Development of a standardized low- or no-power advanced transportation container or container system for blood and blood products that will maintain the cold chain with confirmation and minimize breakage and waste is of critical importance. Specific emphasis should be placed on the following parameters: scalability for different Roles of Care, minimizing weight for each step of the transport process; stackability for usage on military aircraft; ruggedness and reusability justified by the relative cost; integrating or easily used temperature monitoring; size appropriate for required capacity (e.g., two 500 ml whole blood units for medic, 20-40 units at Role of Care 2); minimized power requirements; potential for integration into air, sea, and land vehicles including unmanned aerial systems; and cost must be reasonable versus current operational standards.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will consist of designing schematics and diagrams along with limited testing of technology to be used for a low- or no-power advanced transportation container or container system for blood and blood products, to include techniques for maintaining temperature over lengthy travel times (10+ days), descriptions for monitoring temperature with notification of excursions, and designs for protecting products from breakage. The device will be designed such that usage can be standardized across a variety of environmental factors. Specific emphasis will be placed on weight, stackability, ruggedness, temperature monitoring capability, capacity, power requirements, potential integration into vehicles including unmanned aerial systems, and cost. An argument for the approach chosen will be included.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: This phase will consist of further developing the low- or no-power advanced transportation container or container system for blood and blood products, demonstrating its utility, and validating the prototype(s) through relevant testing. During the first year, the prototype(s) should be demonstrated by the proposer in simulated temperature-controlled and vibration stress-controlled environments and/or in transportation to mimic expectations to determine practical viability. The second year will involve refinement and more rigorous testing of the chosen designs in simulated field tests. Testing and refinement will involve the devices’ functionality within battlefield constraints; the devices must be portable, lightweight if intended for medic kit, stackable if intended for shipping, self-contained, have low or no power requirements, compatible with vehicles including unmanned aerial systems, and have planned production costs that are justifiable against current standards. The phase II commercialization plans should include a regulatory plan for FDA clearance if required.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The technology developed under this SBIR effort will have applicability to both civilian and military emergency medicine. Phase III will consist of finalizing the device design(s) and delivering manufactured devices (in their final form) for military-relevant testing (e.g. environmental, operational, etc.) and FDA-related testing (e.g. blood impact, validation, etc.). The device will be functional for use by blood bank personnel, logisticians, medics, physician assistants, nurses, and physicians in far forward environments (roles 1 and 2 of care). Phase III will also include developing and finalizing training methods and protocols for the new device(s). In addition, the regulatory package should be ready for submission to the FDA, including all relevant test data. The contractor should begin establishing relationships with appropriate commercialization partners (manufacturing, marketing, etc.) to facilitate technology transition.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBogert JN, Harvin JA, Cotton BA.

"topic_title": "Handheld Non-Contact Laser Ultrasound Medical Scanner",
"branch": "Defense Health Program",
"topic_number": "DHA211-012",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and build a non-contact Laser Ultrasound (ncLUS) imaging scanner in the form of a stand-alone lightweight handheld device. The acquired images are to be displayed in real- time using a handheld screen, archived and accessible for reviewing on demand in retrospective analyses.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a real-time medical imaging technique developed in the 1960’s that involves the transmission and reception of high frequency (2-15MHz) sound waves (i.e. acoustic waves) via a piezoelectric transducer located in the US probe that is moved while in contact with the patient skin. US is able to show location and movement of internal organs and blood flow through vessels in the human body by using the amplitudes and travel times of the received reflected sound waves that are reconstructed into an image. This original ‘conventional Ultrasound (US)’ approach is limited by the attenuation of the acoustic waves by air. To yield acceptable image results, conventional US requires a coupling medium (gel/water) added between the US probe and the patient skin.\r\n\r\nLaser Ultrasound (LUS) employs a completely different signal acquisition technology, with advantages for the battlefield, compared to conventional US. LUS uses the light of two low powered lasers transmitted through air to measure acoustic vibrations. It supports rapid use as it only needs to be moved above the patient, with no connecting medium required, no physical contact. This is advantageous in cases where skin contact is prohibited due to burns or, e.g. blast debris wounds. In contrast, conventional US requires contact of a probe with the patient surface accompanied by a contact medium.\r\n\r\nncLUS has recently been demonstrated by Zhang et.al. [1] who acquired in vivo human ultrasound images in a laboratory setting using experimental table-top optics. Zhang et.al. used 1540 nm pulsed source laser to deliver the optical pulses to excite acoustic waves on the tissue surface, and a 1550 nm continuous wave (CW) laser Doppler Vibrometer to measure returning acoustic vibrations on the tissue surface, 1m distant. The optical source for the reported LUS system minimizes tissue penetration, specifically to convert optical energy to acoustic energy at the tissue surface. LUS uses very low power laser light and does not use ionizing radiation, so it is very safe, and safe for eyes.\r\n\r\nWith an appropriate optical design and interferometry, any exposed tissue surfaces can become viable acoustic sources and detectors. Employing skin surface photoacoustic sources in combination with laser interferometric detection (i.e. an optical detector) generates image features in human studies shown by Zhang et.al. to be comparable to images acquired with a conventional US commercial imaging system.\r\n\r\nThis project involves redesigning the ncLUS to have a compact, lightweight, portable format; a shirt- pocket-size handheld imaging scanner similar in size to a cellular phone, with visualization via a wired or wireless handheld screen. The back of the device would contain the scanning lasers. Sides of the device would have connected components, either hinged to flip down, or telescoping. These would assist operating the ncLUS to stand off the body surface as it is moved over the body surface. This project will necessitate innovative engineering. In this physical format, ncLUS can become a powerful asset to evaluate trauma and plan optimal treatment in cases of internal injury. Secondly, the ncLUS can provide a useful training device [2].\r\n\r\nUS, of all medical imaging modalities, has favorable use advantages which include: its reliance on non-ionizing radiation; its real-time cine imaging capability; and, its ability to be built into portable systems having simple power needs (e.g. [3]). ncLUS’s unique additional advantages are: no patient contact; potential for miniaturization; potential for fabrication using low cost solid state electronics; and, no requirement for probes and gels whose use and availability at the POI may be problematic. US trauma imaging includes several standard US examination techniques: Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination - to screen for blood around the heart or abdominal organs; and, extended FAST (eFAST) - to detect pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, or a foreign object. Military use [4] of portable conventional US (i.e. probe with US transducer, processor and screen, gels) in the field currently includes identifying blood in the abdomen, finding fractures, skin infections, and collapsed lungs.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The main goal of Phase I is a feasibility study in the development of a handheld ncLUS scanning device. Initially, to prove feasibility, a physical, electronics, optical and circuit design of the final handheld ncLUS product should be completed as the first deliverable. The electronic and circuit designs should include commercially available electronic, computer and optical components, or components that can be fabricated easily and without extraordinary expense.\r\n\r\nThe physical design of the ncLUS must have a form factor of approximately the width and height of a cell-phone, but may be slightly thicker. It should fit in a shirt breast pocket. Weight should be minimized. The physical design should also include fold-out sides or similar simple, easy to manipulate mechanism in order to provide the key separation between the handheld ncLUS and the body of the subject being scanned. The ncLUS should be designed to operate by battery for a minimum of one hour prior to battery recharging. The scanning device should contain an Android computer capable of performing the computations that reconstruct an image in near-real-time, i.e.>5 updates per second, from the acquired laser signals. This computer should also be able to transmit the images wirelessly or by wire to an external device for display, or use the native screen. Storage of images for replay and archiving should be accomplished using the device, and perhaps an external computer. Innovation is encouraged in each design aspect to create a lighter, more rugged, longer charged device. A second deliverable is a CAD computer model of the scanner, accompanied by a physical mock-up of the scanning device. A third deliverable is a description of the image acquisition and reconstruction methodology. This is necessary because of the innovative role of lasers in signal acquisition. A detailed software schematic must be produced to indicate the real- time computational path leading from the acquired laser signals as they are converted to greyscale image, and as the image is displayed. Specific existing software, or a plan to program new software, must be identified that can accomplish each step involved in the software path. All image data must be compliant with DICOM standards.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The overall objective of Phase II is to produce a fully operational prototype handheld ncLUS scanner in the specified form factor that can acquire human images in tests, archive and display the images on external devices, retrieve the images from the archive and redisplay them. The first goal of Phase II is to produce prototype hardware based on the electronics and optical design of Phase I. The emphasis should be focused on hardware integration and operation during this stage. This task will produce the first deliverable, a 2x or 4x size prototype of the ncLUS that acquires laser signals that can be observed on an oscilloscope. The prototype should initially adhere to the Phase I design except for its physical size. Testing of improvements and changes is then encouraged in order to take advantage of the state-of-the-art in electronics, computers, and optics. The signals should be acquired from an inanimate phantom at this early stage.\r\n\r\nThe next aim is to expand the emphasis to the programming and testing of software for the scanner. The aim of this stage is to produce a second deliverable that is a modified form of the first deliverable, except replete with fully operational software for the acquisition of laser signals, reconstruction of the greyscale images, and transmission of the images to an external handheld computer. Innovation in the transmission, storage and display of images is encouraged. All image data must be compliant with DICOM standards. This system and software should be tested extensively with inanimate phantoms. Power deposition must be demonstrated to not exceed FDA guidelines.  Modifications to the electronics, optics and/or acquisition function should be made at this point. Next, the focus should shift to the production of a fully functional prototype ncLUS scanner in the desired form factor, complete with the computer software needed to perform signal acquisition and all functions for display, archiving and retrieving the acquired images. This scanner should be demonstrated to acquire human images, under an IRB-approved research protocol. One fully functional prototype will constitute the third deliverable, accompanied by validation test reports and other relevant reports and designs. Provide an FDA regulatory plan to illustrate the pathway to clearance.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop training software, sample input and manuals for the system. Due to the device’s small size and likely modest price, the main target for the product is the mass commercial market, i.e. primary care physicians, clinics, and EMT use. The contractor should refine and implement their regulatory strategy for obtaining FDA approval of their technology for use as an US device based on their initial FDA feedback. This phase should culminate in submission to the FDA of the developed technology for approval. In conjunction with FDA submission, the contractor should develop scaled up manufacturing of the technology that follows FDA quality regulations. In addition, the work may result in technology transition to an Acquisition Program managed by the Service Product Developers. The contractor can also propose use to the Services. Utility would be enhanced if the device was easily able to transmit images from phone internet application(s), enabling teleradiology and potentially integrate with artificial intelligence. The ability to provide a non-contact ultrasound device to the battlefield space will enable better visualization of injuries without the need to remove clothing and protective gear before it&#39;s necessary to treat.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tX.

"topic_number": "DHA211-013",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Bio Medical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and build a Terahertz (THz) medical imager in the form of a small, flexible, layered rectangular blanket, with internal functional components, that can be wrapped around the torso of a wounded patient and provide images of internal anatomy.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: THz radiation has a potentially game-changing role in military medical imaging because emerging technology offers the possibility to create portable, lightweight flexible THz imagers.\r\n\r\nTHz radiation has frequencies in the range 0.3-30 THz (1 THz = 1012 Hz), with wavelengths in the range 1 mm (below microwave) to 0.1 mm (above infrared). THz waves can penetrate clothing, among other solid objects, and are now used in some airports to scan passengers and detect dangerous items. THz radiation is an advantageous electromagnetic frequency band for medical imaging due to its low probability of causing tissue damage, since low energy THz photons are non- ionizing and are strongly absorbed by water. THz radiation can produce extremely high resolution images, and is able to image subtle tissue differences due to its high sensitivity to water content.\r\n\r\nPreviously, technical issues prevented construction of practical THz medical imagers. Recently, though, several critical technology advances in THz transmitters and detectors have appeared in the literature. These advances include flexible terahertz detectors using nanotube [1] and graphene [2] and nanowire technologies [3], and a flexible terahertz transmitter [4] using nanoscale technology. In combination, these technologies make it possible to design a flexible, lightweight, portable THz medical imager.\r\n\r\nOne can envision that such an imager can be easily carried and used in many situations to provide imaging capability [5,6]. The THz imager may provide medical images that can reveal acute traumatic injury, e.g. organ damage, internal bleeding, imbedded objects. THz imaging methodology challenges still exist. Scientists have devised a number of methods to extract biomedical information using different forms of THz imaging, as reviewed in [6]. THz phase contrast imaging seems the most successful [6] for biomedical imaging since it offers information about interior density, while absorption techniques are limited to surface imaging due to the strong water absorption of THz waves.\r\n\r\nThis project involves designing a THz imager in the form of a lightweight flexible blanket-like cover composed of a ‘sandwich’ of fabric or flexible plastic, and transmitter and detector components.\r\n\r\nImaginative design is encouraged, to minimize weight, increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and guarantee robustness in demanding conditions. The imager is to be sized 60 cm long x 100 cm wide to wrap and provide medical images from the torso, showing internal organs. Smaller prototypes can be used in testing. Image reconstruction and display should occur on a handheld computer or IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation System) goggles. The THz imager has value in primary care, trauma care, and image-guided interventions. This project involves much innovation and state-of- the-art science, but the THz imager product has the potential to open up a new field and business in medical imaging. Military applications of the imager for trauma care also exist, presenting special challenges particularly in the rapid assessment of internal injuries and hemorrhage, and medical monitoring.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The main goal of Phase I is a feasibility study in the development of a flexible THz imaging device. To prove feasibility, a physical, electronics, and circuit design of the flexible THz imager product should be completed as the first deliverable. The electronic and circuit designs should include the latest in scientific components for THz transmitter and detector.  It must be shown in the feasibility study that the THz imager can be fabricated. Battery power should accommodate two hours of use prior to recharging and comply with Army field battery usage. An added benefit would come from the computer simulation of the first deliverable showing expected operation. Subcontractor(s) should be identified and give written proof of abilities and cooperation if component construction is out-sourced. The second deliverable is the physical design of the imager. The physical design of the THz imager must accommodate the scientific and technical elements identified in the first deliverable. Component costs may limit the size of the demonstration product. The THz imager must be a lightweight flexible blanket-like cover composed of, for example, a ‘sandwich’ of transmitter and detector components sealed within a rugged flexible plastic or synthetic fabric cover. It must have a disposable sterilized cover or be able to be easily cleaned and sterilized. A good example is a flexible MRI receiver coil. Imaginative design and fabrication ideas are encouraged. The imager must be able to operate under normal environmental conditions but it would be an added plus if the product could be designed to operate under extreme temperature conditions experienced by the military (see [7]). The third deliverable is the technical design of the data acquisition – that is, the data acquisition methodology, image reconstruction, filtering options, display, image transmission and archiving using DICOM format. The imaging methodology must be robust and efficient, e.g. THz phase contract imaging that can acquire and display internal anatomy, i.e. organs, tissue and vessels. The imaging methodology must be designed for power deposition within FDA guidelines. Subsequent signal processing steps must be identified or designed. Image reconstruction, filtering, and display should occur on an Android handheld computer or IVAS goggles. The handheld computer must be capable of performing the image reconstruction computations at a rate of approximately 1 image per second or faster if possible, from the acquired data. This computer should also be able to transmit the images by wire or wirelessly to an external device.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The overall objective of Phase II is to produce a fully operational prototype of the flexible THz imager, scaled in size, that can acquire in vivo human images in tests, archive and display the images on external devices, retrieve the images from the archive and redisplay them.. Experimental proof of power deposition will be required to show compliance with FDA guidelines. The first goal of Phase II is to produce scaled prototype imager hardware based on the design of Phase I. The emphasis should be focused on hardware integration and operation during this stage. This task will produce the first deliverable, a prototype of the THz imager that acquires signals from an inanimate phantom that can be observed on an oscilloscope. Testing of improvements and changes is then encouraged in order to take advantage of the state-of-the-art in electronics, computers and other components of the prototype. Next the focus should be expanded to the programming and testing of software for the imager operation, data acquisition and image reconstruction. Produce a second deliverable that is a modified form of the first deliverable, except replete with fully operational software for transmission, detection, and reconstruction of 2D projection greyscale images, and, if possible, 3D tomographic image data (i.e. signals containing depth information). Demonstrate transmission of the images to an external handheld computer and IVAS. The third and final deliverable is the (perhaps modified) prototype THz imager, with handheld computer and all software needed for operation, used to acquire in vivo images from a human limb and torso. Images should be acquired under an IRB-approved research protocol. The fully functional prototype should be accompanied by validation test reports and other relevant reports and designs. Document and deliver a proposed regulatory strategy. Initiate pre-submission discussions with the FDA regarding approval for use. Deliver an FDA proposed regulatory strategy, and a manufacturability plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop software, sample input and manuals for the imager so that it can be disseminated to medical professionals and training provided for its use. Due to the imager’s flexibility, portability and (likely) ease of use, private sector commercial potential can be initially directed at facilities and medical professionals lacking available standard Radiology modalities. The contractor should refine and implement their regulatory strategy for obtaining FDA approval of their technology for use as medical imaging device based on their initial FDA feedback. This phase should culminate in submission to the FDA of the developed technology for approval. In conjunction with FDA submission, the contractor should develop scaled up manufacturing of the technology that follows FDA quality regulations. In addition, the work may result in technology transition to an Acquisition Program managed by the Service Product Developers. The contractor can also propose use to the Services. Utility would be enhanced if the device was easily able to transmit images from phone internet application(s), enabling teleradiology.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tD. Suzuki, S. Oda, Y.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Due to thermal, physical, chemical and oxidative stressors, in-service lubricants may undergo a variety of changes, possibly causing it to exceed specification limits and negatively impacting lubrication performance for various engine applications.     \r\n\r\nAlthough this may be typical for in-service lubricating oils, we are starting to see a slight uptick in recently procured lubricating oil going off-spec, while in Storage tanks (during a duration of 6 months or less). Physical test properties, such as Foaming Characteristics (ASTM D892), Demulsibility (ASTM D1401), Appearance (ASTM D4176), and Moisture Content (ASTM D6304) are valuable quality measures that are impacted by additive packages.        \r\n\r\nIn an effort to understand, screen, prevent and/or mitigate premature degradation of lubricating oil, there is interest in studying lubricating oil additive packages, its effectiveness and impact on oil properties (i.e., foaming, demulsibility, moisture content, etc.), and an initiative to determine if there are causal analysis steps the end user can implement to bring LTL products back on-spec.            \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this study is to prevent product replacement. The interim goal is to build a “fingerprinting” profile database on the MIL-PRF-17331 commodity for future characterization of the LTL lubricating oil.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The goal of this study will be two-fold:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1  Monitor lubricating oil physical test properties, per its relevant specification (i.e., MIL-PRF-17331), as a function of shelf-life time, contaminant intrusion, and additive concentration.\r\n\r\n2.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country (ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement.  Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution with a state-of-the-art capability that operates within the DLA Distribution Warehouse environment. The warehouse AI system may use various sensors (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT)) where applicable. It should minimize the need for infrastructure modifications to enable an artificial intelligence system within the warehouse environment. The goal of this objective is for the vendor to develop a capability for a warehouse AI system that addresses the requirements for integration with a Warehouse Management System (WMS) and a Warehouse Execution System (WES) as specific warehouse infrastructures dictate. This capability will provide for the seamless execution of AI and interactions with Smart Warehouse systems such as 5G Networks, IoT Sensors, Blockchain technology, Quantum Computers, and Machine Learning (ML).\r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art AI solution must integrate into the existing warehouse communications systems to communicate with WES systems when installed. This integration allows Autonomous Guided Vehicles, Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), Robotic Arms, IoT Sensors to receive tasking in an automated fashion to operate frequently and report success or failure at tasking. In support of routine warehouse operations, this research seeks to identify and test AI technology that can be used uninterruptedly and continuously within the DLA Distribution Warehouse environment. This research effort addresses DLA identified cybersecurity requirements through the test and evaluation of government security controls. It leverages current technologies in the AI industry. This research project will operate in locations at designated DLA Distribution Centers in the United States.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Distribution Modernization Program (DMP) topics of interest are research focused on a Continental United States-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution in support of the routine warehouse operations. This research project will involve the use of Commercial/Industry AI technology that can meet the demands of warehouse operations, can be integrated with autonomous warehouse vehicles, robots, and warehouse communications, and be integrated with warehouse navigation systems, 5G Networks, IoT Sensors, Quantum Computing architecture, and warehouse based Machine Learning (ML) that:\r\n\r\n1. Support a joint effort between DLA Research and Development (R&D) and DLA J4 Distribution Headquarters to conduct research and test a warehouse AI system that works with various autonomous platforms, 5G Networks, IoT Sensors, Quantum Computing systems, and ML applications during warehouse operations.\r\n\r\n2. Significantly addresses the AI capabilities of AI within a distribution warehouse operations environment.\r\n\r\n3. Features an AI system able to implement high precision data for regular use in warehouse operations. \r\n\r\n4. Can be integrated into warehouse communications systems such as a WMS or a WES to receive tasking and report status. \r\n\r\n5. Demonstrates a state-of-the-art operational capability when operating within the distribution warehouse environment through the application of AI technology and facilitates a robust communications network technology used in a working environment shared with warehouse workers.\r\n\r\n6. It is a reliable and robust technology solution that allows DLA Distribution Warehouses to perform automated tasks without significantly lower operating speeds per existing industry trends.\r\n\r\n7. Demonstrates compatibility with a Government data cloud environment to store and retrieve warehouse-generated data without relying on a separate commercial data cloud environment to navigate successfully.\r\n\r\n8. Conclusively demonstrates the use of new AI technology and concepts for application and integration in the distribution and delivery of material and goods during representative distribution warehouse operations in an innovative way.\r\n\r\nPROJECT DURATION and COST: \r\n\r\nPHASE I: NTE 12 Months $150K- Base NTE $100K base 6-9 Months, - Option 1 NTE $50K base 3-6 Months\r\n\r\nPHASE II: – NTE 24 Months $1.6M - Base 12-18 months, $1M Option 6 Months NTE $.6M\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The phase one period of performance is not to exceed 12 months total.  Options are not automatic.  Approval is at the discretion of the DLA SBIP Program Manager.  The decision is based on Project Performance, Priorities of the Agency, and/or the availability of funding.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform a design study to determine how to use artificial intelligence to optimize DLA Distribution Warehouse operations, sustainment, and logistics support. Deliver a final design of AI&#39;s capabilities, a simulation model of DLA Distribution assets, and a demonstration of an AI-infused model capable of making intelligent trade-off decisions to meet specified PM requirements. A successful design will optimize support, minimize DLA Distribution Warehouse system downtime, and maximize system availability, using logistics inputs (component failure rates, shipping times, repair times, maintenance man-hours, and warehouse staffing).\r\n\r\nThe research and development goals of Phase I provide Small Business eligible Research and Development firms the opportunity to successfully demonstrate how their proposed warehouse AI concept of operations (CONOPS) improves the distribution of goods and materials within the DLA distribution enterprise and effectively lessens the time to provide needed supplies to the Warfighter. The selected vendor will conduct a feasibility study to:\r\n\r\n1. Address the requirements described above in the Description Section for warehouse AI operations.\r\n\r\n2. Identify capability gap(s) and the requirement for DLA to use AI in the DLA Distribution Operations environment.\r\n\r\n3. Develop the vendor&#39;s Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to utilize warehouse AI and describe clearly how the requirements develop from it.\r\n\r\nNote: During Phase I of the SBIR, testing is not required.\r\n\r\nThe vendor must create a CONOPS for Warehouse AI in support of both routine and wartime distribution warehouse operations. The concept of operations will cover the utilization of artificial intelligence within distribution warehouses during routine procedures, describing precisely all operational requirements as part of this process. This artificial intelligence requirement intends to operate inside distribution warehouses successfully.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables for this project include a final report, including a cost breakdown of courses of action.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the research and the concept of operations developed during Phase I, the research and development goals of Phase II emphasizes the execution of the Warehouse AI system following the typical DLA Distribution Warehouse concept of operations for materiel handling. During Phase II, the vendor will:\r\n\r\n1. Address the specific user requirements, functional requirements, and system requirements as defined and provided by DLA.\r\n\r\n2. Develop a prototype Warehouse AI system for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E).\r\n\r\n3. Implement government cybersecurity controls in the prototype design and secure all necessary cybersecurity certifications to operate the equipment in the DLA warehouse environment with DOD cloud connections. \r\n\r\n4. Design the prototype equal to the technology maturity of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9 after Phase II.\r\n\r\n5. Deliver a final Distribution Warehouse AI prototype system to DLA capable of successfully executing the operational concepts established in the Phase I CONOPS.\r\n\r\nThe DLA Warehouse Artificial Intelligence system will operate across the United States at various DLA Distribution Center sites mutually agreed upon between DLA R&D and DLA Distribution HQ. This project&#39;s deliverables include a final report, including a cost breakdown of courses of action (COAs).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: PHASE III: Dual Use Applications: At this point, there is no specific funding associated with Phase III. During Phase I and Phase II, the progress made should result in a vendor&#39;s qualification as an approved source for a Warehouse Artificial Intelligence system and support participation in future procurements.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIALIZATION:  The manufacturer will pursue the commercialization of the Warehouse Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and designs developed to apply to the warehouse environment. The processes developed in preliminary phases and potential commercial sales of manufactured mechanical parts or other items. The first path for commercial use will be at DLA&#39;s twenty-six Distribution Centers and twenty Disposition Centers. When fielded, DLA estimates 20 - 26 units, but the number of units could be more.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAlex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Nuclear, and General Warfighting Requirements (GWR)\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks technologies and processes in Additive Manufacturing (AM) to enhance recycling and reuse of powders, test specimens, and scrap materials to produce additional material feedstock domestically.  All the areas of recycling and manufacturing technologies provide potential avenues toward achieving breakthrough advances. Proposed efforts funded under this topic may encompass any specific discrete-parts or materials recycling, manufacturing, or processing technology at any level resulting in a unit cost reduction, availability of feedstock material, and reduced environmental impact from the manufacturing of products.\r\n\r\nResearch and Development efforts selected under this topic shall demonstrate and involve a degree of risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established.  Further, proposed efforts must be judged to be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or less, but greater than TRL 3 to receive funding consideration.\r\n\r\nTRL 3.  (Analytical and Experimental Critical Function and/or Characteristic Proof of Concept)\r\n\r\nTRL 6.  (System/Subsystem Model or Prototype Demonstration in a Relevant Environment)\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The DLA Research & Development (R&D) is looking to develop the capability to recycle and recover AM powder, test specimens, and scrap materials produced during the part manufactruing process throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and domestic manufacturers. As AM continues to mature and the demand for AM powder increases, new innovative ways to collect and recycle scrap metal/powder into a useable AM grade powder as well as recycling AM powder not utilized in the build process are needed to reduce the production unit cost and secure feedstock supply.  The goal is to identify and recover AM powder, at a suitable purity level, suitable to be reused and in a form that it could be reintroduced into manufacturing at a later point in time. Developing an economically viable, environmentally friendly process for recycling of AM powders from the existing manufacturing process could facilitate the establishment of a viable, competitive domestic supply chain.  If this produces a viable reclamation methodology and sustainable process it may lead to follow-on efforts at the discretion of the US Government. The R&D tasks include identifying potential additional feedstock sources in the existing DoD supply chain and developing processes for AM recycling. The process should be amenable to the scale of operation required in AM manufacturing, and will improve the economics of AM powders from recovered material for reuse, rather than depend on costly foreign reliance.\r\n\r\nPROJECT DURATION and COST: \r\n\r\nPHASE I: NTE 12 Months $150K- Base NTE $100K base 6-9 Months, - Option 1 NTE $50K base 3-6 Months\r\n\r\nPHASE II: – NTE 24 Months $1.6M - Base 12-18 months, $1M Option 6 Months NTE $.6M\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The phase one period of performance is not to exceed 12 months total.

Include a plan to demonstrate the innovative recycling process and address implementation approaches for near term insertion into the manufacture of Department of Defense (DoD) systems, subsystems, components, or parts.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop applicable and feasible process demonstration for the approach described, and demonstrate a degree of commercial viability.  Validate the feasibility of the innovative process by demonstrating its use in the production, testing, and integration of items for DLA and DoD.  Validation would include, but not be limited to, prototype quantities, data analysis, laboratory tests, system simulations, operation in test-beds, or operation in a demonstration system.  A partnership with a current or potential supplier to DoD, DLA, OEM, or other suitable partner is highly desirable.  Identify commercial benefit or application opportunities of the innovation.  Innovative processes should be developed with the intent to readily transition to production in support of DoD and its supply chains.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Technology transition via successful demonstration of a new process technology.  This demonstration should show near-term application to one or more Department of Defense systems, subsystems, or components.  This demonstration should also verify the potential for enhancement of quality, reliability, performance and/or reduction of unit cost or total ownership cost of the proposed subject.  Private Sector Commercial Potential: Material manufacturing improvements, including development of domestic manufacturing capabilities, have a direct applicability to all defense system technologies.  Material manufacturing technologies, processes, and systems have wide applicability to the defense industry including air, ground, sea, and weapons technologies.  Competitive material manufacturing improvements should have leverage into private sector industries as well as civilian sector relevance.  Many of the technologies under this topic would be directly applicable to other DoD agencies, NASA, and any commercial manufacturing venue.  Advanced technologies for material manufacturing would directly improve production in the commercial sector resulting in reduced cost and improved productivity.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEMERGENT III Research & Development Broad Agency Announcement (BAA0002-20)\r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "SiC BiCMOS Platform Development",
"branch": "Defense Microelectronics Activity",
"topic_number": "DMEA211-001",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Microelectronics\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To develop a BiCMOS platform utilizing SiC wafer to achieve high temperature operation and high voltage/power integration.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: As a result of almost four decades long investment on SiC technology by DoD and technical breakthroughs achieved by private sectors, affordable high-voltage SiC MOSFETs debut in the market recently [1][2]. The 650+V SiC MOSFETs become popular switching devices in data center, renewable energy, and even electric vehicle applications thanks to excellent energy efficiency and reduction in the power conversion system size and weight.\r\n\r\nWhile discrete SiC power devices are successfully commercialized, separate efforts to develop SiC integrated circuits (ICs), that can be used in high temperature and high radiation environments, have continued for a decade. Those ICs were mostly based on non-CMOS, (i.e. bipolar transistor [3], MESFET [4] and JFET [5][6]) due to many technical barriers in SiC CMOS technology such as low channel mobility, uneven performance of NMOS vs. PMOS, forming resistive ohmic contacts, and gate oxide reliability.\r\n\r\nMore recently, advantages such as convenient digital circuit design using standard libraries and low power consumption of CMOS configuration drive big corporations [7][8] and small businesses [9][10] to jump into the SiC CMOS IC development competition. Despite these aspirations and effort, decent SiC CMOS technology development will not be easy to overcome the fundamental material properties of SiC including high gate oxide/SiC interface states.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this solicitation is to develop and demonstrate a SiC BiCMOS platform that can be applied up to 300°C ambient temperature. Base materials for this solicitation include, but are not limited to bulk or epitaxial SiC wafer, Si/SiC direct bonding (Si/SiC DB) wafer, or Si-epitaxial grown on SiC substrate (Si-epi/SiC) wafer. \r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform a Feasibility Study that addresses the gate oxide related parameters such as channel mobility, gate tunneling current, time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), bias temperature instability (BTI), and yield (extrinsic failure rate). Key parameters related to the gate oxide should meet requirements as below.  \r\n\r\n- NMOSFET channel mobility > 50 cm2/V·s \r\n\r\n- PMOSFET channel mobility > 10 cm2/V·s\r\n\r\n- Threshold voltage shift (for NMOSFET and PMOSFET) < ±500 mV at bias-temperature stress during mean time to failure\r\n\r\nWhen Si/SiC DB or Si-epi/SiC wafers are used, Si/SiC interface and across-wafer uniformity should be characterized by various imaging tools and spectroscopy. All junction combinations between (n and p-type) Si and (n and p-type) SiC have to be characterized electrically to monitor the ohmic and p-n junction behavior. Key parameters related to SiC/Si interface should meet requirements as below.\r\n\r\n- Void free and continuous SiC/Si interface throughout entire wafer\r\n\r\n- Bonding interface thickness (thickness of SiO2, amorphous Si or carbon rich region) < 10 nm\r\n\r\n- Bonding interface state density < 1x1012  eV-1cm-2\r\n\r\nIf those key parameters are not met the requirements, detailed plans for improvement of those reliability and performance parameters during phase II must be proposed. \r\n\r\nPHASE II: Prototype deliveries of phase II are development of wafer fabrication process and Process Design Kit (PDK). Based on the process, statistical data of critical parameters and reliability (mostly gate oxide related) data for technology qualification are to be reported. For CMOS transistors and high-voltage LDMOS, BSIM (or BSIM equivalent or modified BSIM) models incorporating statistical data shall be included in the PDK. \r\n\r\nDuring the first year of phase II, TCAD simulations on n-channel and p-channel LDMOS (45V, 120V, and 650V) and other active and passive devices are necessary to define device architecture, dimension, and doping profile. Wafer processing modules (gate/field oxidation, isotropic/anisotropic etch, implant, activation/annealing, and contact/interconnect/pad metallization) on SiC or Si/SiC wafer should be developed. When SiC bulk or epitaxial wafer is used, process development should be carried out including efforts to improve gate oxide integrity, PMOS transconductance, source/drain/body ohmic contacts, and passive components temperature dependency. When Si/SiC wafer is used, wafer bonding or Si epitaxial processes, which can reproduce Si/SiC wafers, must be identified. All the process modules should be matured and stabilized.  \r\n\r\nDuring the second year of phase II, all BiCMOS platform device components, which comprise of core logic CMOS transistors, analog MOSFETs (for current mirrors, differential pairs, etc), bipolar transistors, passives (diffusion and poly resistors, gate oxide or MIM capacitors), and high-voltage (45V, 120V, and 650V) LDMOSs are to be fabricated on a single die, and characterized at temperature range over -55C to 300C. Performance of those devices are to be improved/optimized though multiple test vehicles. \r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Continuous efforts may be needed to further stabilize the process flow which ensures product reliability to embody strong business case. Variations of the baseline flow are to be developed, for example, different technology nodes, gate oxide thickness, and LDMOS voltage ratings. The BiCMOS platforms could be utilized for smart power IC production, second source manufacturing or licensing. \r\n\r\nSiC wafer platform is advantageous for high-temperature and radiation hardened ICs (when semi-insulating SiC substrates are used). On the other hand, Si/SiC wafer platform allows hybrid integration of high density Si CMOS logic and SiC high-voltage power devices. The platform could take advantage of Si/SiC heterojunction properties to enhancing LDMOS performance [11][12]. \r\n\r\nThose platforms are highly attractive to NASA’s space programs, Air Force’s aircrafts, Army’s combat electric vehicles and nuclear facilities where harsh environment electronics are required. Analog Devices’ AD8229 and ADXL206 are notable commercialized Si based products available in the market targeting oil/gas drilling, aerospace, and geothermal applications under 200°C ambient temperature. Many defense and civilian industries are anticipating SiC IC products that can operate above the Si temperature limit.\r\n\r\nThe Si/SiC DB wafer has not been commercialized simply due to lack of demand. If the Si/SiC platform development is successful, it would create demand for Si/SiC DB wafers as a base material for the BiCMOS IC production. Therefore, Si/SiC wafer manufacturing business will be a promising derivative from the platform development. \r\n\r\nPotential Value to DoD: Because weapon systems operate under unexpected theatrical conditions, the systems have to be small, light, and energy efficient to meet size/weight/power (SWaP) goal of DoD. SiC BiCMOS ICs help to achieve the goals by making electronic modules simple, highly functional, and intelligent.  \r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“Silicon Carbide CoolSiC™ MOSFETs,” https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/mosfet/silicon-carbide/\r\n\t“Announcing the Wolfspeed 650V Series of SiC MOSFETs,” https://www.wolfspeed.com/knowledge-center/article/announcing-the-wolfspeed-650v-series-of-sic-mosfets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=650V&gclid=Cj0KCQjwupD4BRD4ARIsABJMmZ_YAs2Xr8X0N4713cHWDjofl4GJZu7bfk_2l-ub1sYI-yHFofrf4oEaAuuaEALw_wcB\r\n\tShakti Singh, “Bipolar Integrated Circuits in 4H-SiC,” IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 2011\r\n\tViorel Banu, “High Temperature-Low Temperature Coefficient Analog Voltage Reference Integrated Circuit Implemented with SiC MESFETs,” ESSCIRC, 2013\r\n\tKuang Sheng, “Demonstration of the first SiC power integrated circuit,” Solid State Electronics, 2008\r\n\tPhilip G.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Microelectronics\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace, Electronics, Sensors\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE:  Develop a tool for automated, procedural planar serial sectioning of semiconductor microelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Serial sectioning Integrated Circuits (ICs) to perform Failure Analysis (FA), Fault Isolation (FI), Reverse Engineering (RE), and Design Validation (DV) is time-consuming and repetitive work that is well suited for human-robot collaboration and robotic automation. Frontside, backside, and crosswise serial sectioning of IC samples often requires operators to maintain a serial sectioning precision to within less than twenty nanometers for multiple hours or days, often leading to operator fatigue and error. The wet chemistry, polishing slurries and pressurized nitrogen flows involved in serial sectioning do not easily lend themselves to bench-top systems. A larger, human-scale processing space oriented around an extended robotic arm with the ability to transition samples between acid baths of etchant, colloidal silica polishing slurries, liquid-soaked cleaning pads, sonicating baths of cleaning solvents, and compressed nitrogen gasses for drying samples is a realistic approach to both automating these processes and to minimizing the cost of maintaining equipment. The physical separation between each serial sectioning process that a robotic arm affords will prevent cross-contamination of materials, allow ease of access for preventative maintenance and routine equipment cleaning, and prevent liquids and corrosives from damaging mechanical and electrical equipment. A robotic arm also allows for the possibility of automatically inserting samples into a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) after each successive serial sectioning step. Current technology is limited to automatic frontside, backside, and crosswise serial sectioning to within accuracies of approximately one micron. Defense Microelectronics Activity needs the capability to do this to within tens of nanometers. While humans are able to perform all three of these processes, repeatability between sample preparation is often inconsistent, and both the great length of time it takes to perform coupled with limited numbers of personnel makes it impossible to validate the designs of and perform failure analysis on the large quantity of microelectronics employed by DoD. It is critical to national security and to the work being done by multiple DoD initiatives across different agencies that these processes become automated in the near future. \r\n\r\nPHASE I:  Feasibility study of automatic serial sectioning an IC to an arbitrary metal layer in a planar manner that results in all vias being present, along with a relatively uniform interlayer dielectric material (ILD), and all metal lines beneath it. Having all three of these present in a single image: vias, the ILD to hold the vias in place, and the metal lines beneath the ILD is the first preliminary benchmark of the automatic serial sectioning system. The following requirements should be met:\r\n\r\n1) Material removal with an accuracy of less one-hundred nanometers across a one square centimeter IC with reference to the initial planar surface of the IC, or less than 0.0006° tilt.\r\n\r\n2) Highly perpendicular crosswise serial sectioning to within 90°±0.0006°.\r\n\r\n3) Serial-sectioning to a target location with accuracy of less than a micron.  \r\n\r\n4) Microscope images should be taken while serial-sectioning. All vias and metal lines of the layer of interest should be present at time of imaging, and the microscope should be capable of imaging these vias and metal lines up to 500x magnification. \r\n\r\n5) A study should be done on how to make all equipment and machinery self-contained, requiring no external plumbing, drainage, or ventilation. Details should be provided on how this will be achieved in Phase II.    \r\n\r\n6) Detailed recipes, stating rates or times taken to serial section, and clean IC samples should be provided. All equipment, chemicals, materials, and supplies employed in the process should be stated.  \r\n\r\n7) DMEA users of the tool should have the full ability to program the machine to suit their needs. The software should include flexibility to modify serial sectioning recipes and parameters.\r\n\r\n8) Detailed plans of all mechanical parts designed for this contract should be furnished to DMEA in original digital format. \r\n\r\nDeliver a feasibility report of research and innovation, including a list of possible components, a storyboard of software that will control the tool and a program plan for system development. If any of the above restraints cannot be adhered to, the report must include relevant research and rationale. If adhering to the above constraints is possible, but not financially feasible, the report must include relevant research and rationale.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the aforementioned study and applicable innovation, \r\n\r\n1) Produce a fully functioning self-contained prototype that adheres to all the constraints listed in Phase I. \r\n\r\n2) Test the prototype and deliver along with at least (3) samples for each application, for a total of (9) samples. The applications are: Frontside, backside, and crosswise serial sectioning. The samples should all be the same device (to be determined during Phase I) and should show the process repeatability between both samples. \r\n\r\n3) Deliver a complete Bill of Materials (BOM), including all part numbers used, manufacturers, quantities, technical datasheets, facility requirements, and deliver CAD files and digital designs of all mechanical parts designed for this SBIR.\r\n\r\n4) Provide multiple images showing individual IC metal layers, along with ILD, and all vias intact showing that the process is repeatable. For example, only seven of these types of images for a seven metal layer device are required to obtain all data of the entire integrated circuit design layout. Due to time constraints, this requirement is not mandatory, although this is one of the intended purposes of the equipment. It will do a great service to the reputed capability of the system if it demonstrates that it can validate the design of an entire IC by frontside serial sectioning.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There may be opportunities for further development of this system for use in a specific military or commercial application.  During a Phase III program, offerors may refine the performance of the design and produce pre-production quantities for evaluation by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Robotic Microelectronic Planar Serial Sectioning would be applicable to both commercial and government semiconductor device research and FA. Government applications include FA, FI, DV and RE of semiconductors. Commercial applications include FA and FI of semiconductors.\r\n\r\nPotential Value to DoD: High throughput serial sectioning of integrated circuits for the purposes of failure analysis, fault isolation, reverse engineering, design validation and counterfeit inspection is critical to national security. Given the sheer quantity of microelectronics employed by DoD, automation is a realistic approach to performing these tasks at scale.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tKimura, A., Scholl, J., Schaffranek, J., Sutter, M., Elliott, A, Strizich, M. & David, G., A Decomposition Workflow for Integrated Circuit Verification and Validation, J Hardw Syst Secur (2020) 1-10.\r\n\tUchic, M., Groeber, M., Shah, M., Callahan, P., Shiveley, A., Scott, M., Chapman, M. and Spowart, J., An automated multi-modal serial sectioning system for characterization of grain-scale microstructures in engineering materials, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on 3D Materials Science (2012) 195-202. \r\n\tHorstmann, H., Körber, C., Sätzler, K., Aydin, D., & Kuner, T., Serial section scanning electron microscopy (S 3 EM) on silicon wafers for ultra-structural volume imaging of cells and tissues, PloS one (2012), 7(4) e35172.\r\n\tZankel, A., Wagner, J. and Poelt, P., Serial sectioning methods for 3D investigations in materials science.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy; Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Weapons\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a suite of compact multi-weapon system payloads that deliver scalable Intermediate Force Capability (IFC) effects combined with other military effects for: applicability and effectiveness in multiple domains; synergistic value of integrating the various IFC effects with other multi-use military capabilities in a common architecture, such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); secure communications; and automated fire control systems, all integrated aboard small manned and unmanned systems (UxS) platforms. Platforms include small tactical vehicles/vessels and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for both urban and austere terrains, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for both counter-air and ground support operations, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for both the littorals and open water operations, and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This SBIR topic seeks to develop a suite of more compact and lightweight long range non-lethal counter-personnel and counter-materiel payloads for integration on small tactical vehicles/platforms and UxS. These IFC payloads will support a variety of stabilization operations, gray zone warfare, and regular and irregular warfare missions across the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO) [Refs 1,2]. These non-lethal (NL)/IFC payloads with enhanced system performance seek to mitigate codified joint non-lethal weapon capability-gaps. There is Service transition interest in these NL/IFC payloads in both the Maritime (U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard) and Ground (U.S. Army and USMC) domains as each Service currently desires IFCs via small/lightweight low-cost systems that can project/provide long-range IFCs. These desired effects across the full breadth of the ROMO must be accomplished with integration of these small NL/IFC payloads on tactical manned and unmanned platforms with significant reduced overall system size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling (-55 degrees C to 125 degrees C) and lower system costs (SWAP/C2) [Ref 5]. Existing IFCs have known range and overall system size and weight limitations, i.e., the current COTS solutions only mitigate a very small portion of the codified Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved counter-personnel and counter-materiel capability-gap. This topic supports future long range compact and lightweight IFC to provide long range hail and warn, non-lethal counter-personnel tasks: such as deny access, move, suppress, and disable individuals and non-lethal counter-materiel tasks: such as stop/disable vehicles, vessels and aircraft. \r\n\r\nThese new innovative compact/lightweight IFC payloads include existing, both commercial off the shelf (COTS) and developmental, NL weapon technologies/stimuli such as: (1) dazzling lasers, (2) 12 gauge/40mm non-lethal munitions (blunt impact, flashbang, riot control agents, human electro-muscular incapacitation, malodorant) with associated munition launching/targeting and fire control systems; (3) long range acoustic hailing devices, and (4) directed energy (DE) weapons such as counter-electronics (e.g., high power microwave weapons) and Active Denial Technologies (ADT). These new innovative payloads shall also include new/novel non-lethal payloads with innovative human effects and new non-lethal stimuli such as optogenics modulation of high magnetic fields and other new non-lethal stimuli that provide long range IFCs such as: (1) long range hail and warn capabilities; (2) area denial – deny access capabilities; (3) human target suppression; (4) ability to move individuals and/or groups of individuals from open and confined spaces; and (5) ability to non-lethally incapacitate/disable threat human/material targets. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on Phase II of this project as set forth by DCSA and MCSC in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a wide variety of non-lethal stimuli for integration on a small tactical vehicle/platform and small UxSs, ensuring that each payload will have a minimal cost (of $10’s of thousands of dollars vice payloads that cost > $1M) and weigh less than 50-100 lbs and with a compact form-fit of < 3 cu ft. \r\n\r\nDemonstrate the feasibility/effectiveness of these novel Non-Lethal/IFC payloads with existing non-lethal weapon effectiveness models and against real counter-material targets such as against relevant threat vehicle and vessel engine targets. Collect weapon effectiveness data at range, e.g., Radio Frequency (RF) Target Susceptibility data corresponding to a Radio Frequency (RF) - High Power Microwave (HPM) payload’s waveform against a broad relevant set of targets (e.g., threat vehicle and vessel engine) and human effects and weapon effectiveness data for non-lethal counter-personnel payloads. Demonstrate individual NL/IFC payload weapon effectiveness and performance data as well as this same type of data for a “combined effect” suite of NL/IFC Payloads. Demonstrate meeting JNLWD/JIFCO/Marine Corps needs and establish that the NL/IFC payloads weapon concept can be employed throughout the Joint Services. Establish weapon concept feasibility/effectiveness by rigorous NL/IFC individual and combined effects testing against both threat personnel and counter-materiel targets. Phase I will not require human subject or animal subject testing. Provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals and key technical milestones that addresses technical risk reduction and defines the development of a suite of compact/lightweight/low-cost Phase II non-lethal/IFC payloads integrated to small manned and unmanned systems.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a suite of optimized (size/weight/cost) Non-Lethal/IFC payloads integrated to small manned systems and UxSs. Evaluate the prototype NL/IFC payloads via rigorous counter-personnel and counter-materiel target testing at both the contractor’s facilities and at DoD laboratories such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Dahlgren Division (NSWC- Dahlgren) test ranges. The JNLWD-JIFCO maintains a set of counter-personnel human effects and weapon effectiveness models and a full set of counter-personnel and counter-material test targets at various DoD labs. Deliver the suite of NL/IFC payloads for manned and unmanned systems to Government lab facilities to be independently assessed and evaluated, with minimal cost to the performer, to determine the weapon’s capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development plan and the Marine Corps requirements for a suite of non-lethal/IFC payloads. Demonstrate system performance through the evaluation of the NL/IFC payload’s ability to meet known non-lethal counter-personnel and counter-materiel capability-gaps. Confirm and verify modeling and analytical methods developed in Phase I to include measuring the required full range of parameters including numerous deployment cycles. Use evaluation results to refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet the JIFCO/JNLWD/Marine Corps non-lethal/IFC payload requirements. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Joint Service use. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the JIFCO/JNLWD/Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Joint Service use. Develop this suite of next-generation NL/IFC payloads as integrated on GOTS manned and unmanned systems. Evaluate these weapons to determine their effectiveness in operationally relevant environments, e.g., Limited Military User Assessments (LMUAs) held by various Services. Support the JIFCO/JNLWD/Marine Corps for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Joint Service use. \r\n\r\nA suite of compact, lightweight, low-cost long range non-lethal intermediate force capability payloads have significant commercial applications beyond the DoD including other government agencies such as the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to include Customs and Border Protection, which have actively been researching these type of non-lethal counter-personnel and counter-materiel effects. Local civilian law enforcement has these specific type of missions to support both counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions for law enforcement as well as to mitigate terrorist acts. Currently overall system size, weight, and cost have hindered the use of these systems by these agencies. This SBIR topic specifically addresses overall system size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling, and overall system cost all while drastically improving NL/IFC weapon performance.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLeimbach, Wendell. “The Commandant’s Guidance for the DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program.” Marine Corps Gazette, May 2020. https://www.jnlwp.defense.gov/Press-Room /In-The-News/Acticle/2213225/the-commandants-guidance-for-the-dod-non-lethl-weapons-program/  \r\n\tBerger, David H. “Executive Agent’s Planning Guidance 2020 – Intermediate Force Capabilities – Bridging the Gap Between Presence and Lethality.” U.S. Department of Defense Non-Lethal Weapons Program, March 2020. https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/DoD-NLW-EA-Planning-Guidance-March-2020.pdf  \r\n\tKlein, David. “Unmanned Systems & Robotics in the FY2019 Defense Budget.” https://www.auvsi.org/%E2%80%8Bunmanned-systems-and-robotics-fy2019-defense-budget  \r\n\t“Demand for unmanned surface vehicles driven by non-lethal assignments.” GlobalData Plc 2020, John Carpenter House, John Carpenter Street, London, EC4Y OAN, UK, 24 Feb 2020. https://www.globaldata.com/demnd-for-unmanned-surface-vehicles-driven-by-non-lethal-assignments/  \r\n\t“MIL-STD-810G, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TEST METHOD STANDARD: ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING CONSIDERATIONS AND LABORATORY TESTS” October 31, 2008. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-810G_12306/\r\n\r\n",

Current Authorized Medical Allowance List (AMAL) logistical resupply is handled through the push or pull of large resupply or consumable blocks consisting of 1-5 pallets of environmentally ruggedized cases (e.g., AMAL 636, Battalion Aid Supplies). These resupply blocks are a “one size fits all” approach based upon the projected needs for a fixed number of patients per a fixed time period and do not take into account the actual consumption rates of specific medical products. This approach drastically increases the logistical footprint and cannot flexibly adjust to specific needs as driven by operational use. \r\n\r\nAdvances in wireless information technology are bringing the Navy Medical Corpsmen new ways to monitor and track patients in the theater (e.g., the USAF Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL’s) Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit or BATDOK, and Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory’s (MCWL’s) prototype concept, Medical Common Operating Picture (MedCOP). Advances in automated and expeditionary Unmanned Systems (UxS) could be applied as new methods of “small-payload on the spot” delivery of critical medical resupply items, such as blood products or medical consumables (e.g., drugs, bandages, IV lines) to Navy Corpsmen. These technologies, when combined with supply tracking technologies such as RFID, offer the potential for the real-time tracking of medical consumable use rates and for automated Push-Pull resupply requests for medical consumables. For example, the consumption of intravenous needle/tubing kits in response to battlefield casualties can be automated to keep track of the number of kits on hand at a field medical facility and automatically send a demand signal for additional kits once a critical threshold is reached. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms can hypothetically be developed that can predict future resupply needs based upon operational tempo and tracked casualty types. Such a predictive algorithm could automatically send demand signals in advance of casualty arrival at a field medical facility. \r\n\r\nA Just-in-Time Medical Logistical Resupply System (JITMEDLOG) relieves the Navy Medical Corpsmen from the necessity to actively track consumable use rates by automatically tracking usage and automatically initiating critical resupply via unmanned vehicles (UxV) or other expeditionary means. It offers the ability for custom delivery of needed medical supplies while avoiding waste and oversupply. JITMEDLOG further allows for a smaller initial deployment footprint, reducing the upfront logistical burden and allowing for the deployment of more mobile and expeditionary medical teams, which will be critical under Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). \r\n\r\nThe proposed system must address the following requirements, at a minimum: \r\n\r\n• The USMC seeks the development of new algorithms and architecture integration to add Just-In-Time Medical Logistical tracking technology and predictive algorithms to the Project Phoenix architecture (e.g., BATDOK, MedCOP). \r\n\r\n• The JITMEDLOG shall integrate with BATDOK and the prototype MedCOP architecture. \r\n\r\n• The JITMEDLOG shall integrate with existing DoD medical logistics systems (e.g., DMLSS). \r\n\r\n• The JITMEDLOG shall be compatible with UAS critical resupply systems. Any JITMEDLOG hardware supporting this architecture shall comply with MIL-STD-810x standards for use in all operational environments to which the USMC deploys. \r\n\r\n• The JITMEDLOG shall be designed for use by any Navy Medical Corpsman, regardless of Navy Enlisted/Officer Code or specialty, and include new user training and operator and maintainer manuals. \r\n\r\n• System transactions shall be timestamped. \r\n\r\n• The system shall be accessible to all Expeditionary Medical and Tactical C2 nodes on the network. \r\n\r\n• The system architecture shall provide location and inventory of Class VIII supplies. \r\n\r\n• The system architecture shall provide the ability to send/receive forms. \r\n\r\n• User interfaces shall provide the ability to copy and paste information within various user screens/forms. • The system shall create a network sharable list of all consumables. \r\n\r\n• The system shall create a network sharable list of blood supply. \r\n\r\n• The system shall create a network sharable list of equipment. \r\n\r\n• The system shall automatically pull information from designated sensors or databases relevant for the display. \r\n\r\n• The system shall allow the user to enter information relevant to the display. \r\n\r\n• The system shall minimize data sets when possible through packet size and compression to leverage narrow bandwidth. \r\n\r\n• The system shall be capable of operation in an A2AD environment in mind.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an architecture for a Just-in-Time Medical Logistical Resupply System (JITMEDLOG) that meets the requirements described above. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs. Establish that the concepts can be developed into a useful product (software and hardware) for the Marine Corps. Prove feasibility through material testing and analytical modeling, as appropriate. Provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals and key technical milestones, and addresses technical risk reduction.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a scaled prototype. Evaluate the prototype to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development plan and the Marine Corps requirements for the Just-in-Time Medical Logistical Resupply system. Demonstrate system performance through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the required range of parameters, including numerous deployment cycles. Use evaluation results to refine the prototype into an design that meets Marine Corps requirements. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Marine Corps use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use. Develop the Just-in-Time Medical Logistical Resupply system for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment. Develop commercial operator and maintainer manuals and user new equipment training programs to support the system’s operations and maintenance in the field environment. Support the Marine Corps for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use. \r\n\r\nJITMEDLOG technology has potential for use with commercial and non-governmental organization in remote areas such as interior Africa, remote parts of Alaska or Canada, the Amazon basin, or other places lacking in infrastructure. Such technology can be used for disaster relief or pandemic response and can support remote hospitals and other medical facilities, vaccination efforts, or even non-medical applications such as critical equipment or food/water deliveries.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“MIL-STD810H.

"topic_title": "Real-Time Detection, Location, and Isolation of High-Resistance, Wye Power System Ground Faults",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-003",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics; Human Systems; Information Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a solution, consisting of hardware and software, to detect and locate ground faults in a high-resistance, wye grounded, pulsed power system in real time.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: An existing system will benefit from increased ability to detect and locate ground faults. Although, solutions will ultimately integrate with equipment already available in said system’s current health monitoring infrastructure, it is understood that new software and (in all likelihood) additional hardware will be needed to achieve the objective. \r\n\r\nGround faults occur due to insulation breakdown. A high-resistance, wye grounded, electrical power system is tolerant of one ground fault on any phase, but not multiple ground faults in different locations on the same phase. Since the existing system does not indicate when a first line-to-ground fault occurs, cables are regularly inspected using an insulation resistance tester. Although this process enables manual detection of ground faults, determining location for corrective action is more difficult. A less arduous, real time solution will assure that all ground faults are being detected and reported within milliseconds of occurring, which will increase overall safety of the system. The goal is to detect and locate the first ground fault virtually immediately, and correct it as soon as possible, so that there is never an instance in which two ground faults occur in different locations on the same phase. \r\n\r\nInsulation breakdown in a particular location may result in a single line-to-ground fault. This line-to-ground fault causes very low fault currents, on the order of .01% of load current, and must be detected, located, and isolated before another ground fault occurs on the same phase. Shipboard ground faults can be located anywhere in runs of several hundred feet of hard-to-reach cable. Fault currents are in the milliamp (mA) range in a system that nominally carries several kiloamps (kAs). Thus, solutions must reliably and accurately detect and locate ground faults that generate signals orders of magnitude smaller than operational currents, which may be alternating or direct (AC/DC) depending on cable section. Operating voltage levels are also in the kV range. \r\n\r\nInsulation breakdown in a second location may result in undesired large current flow between the two fault locations, resulting in catastrophic damage to the power system, its equipment, and possibly other high-power equipment. \r\n\r\nThe solution must be capable of detecting ground faults of 10,000 Ohms or less. False negatives should not occur below the 10,000-Ohm threshold, and false positives should be minimized as searching for non-existent cable faults would prove burdensome and decrease confidence in the detection system. A false positive rate of 1% or below is considered appropriate at this time, but an official requirement has not yet been established. Measuring the exact resistance value (in Ohms) of the fault is not as vital as simply identifying that a ground fault is present, so accuracy, resolution, and sensitivity of the measurement are not defined at this time. Location should be determined with reasonable accuracy and resolution (e.g., ±10s of feet) to decrease mean time to repair (MTTR). Solutions that significantly narrow down location of faults are preferred, since they will decrease the time required to find and fix the damaged cable. \r\n\r\nIn summary, an innovative approach is needed to indicate the presence and location of an active ground fault in real time, so that it can be remedied before a second ground fault occurs. Additional capability may include prognostics that detect/predict the formation of ground faults before they occur.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for detecting and locating ground faults with minimal impact to existing power architecture. Validate the concept and demonstrate feasibility utilizing modeling and simulation and other software/hardware tools. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype to validate/verify the technological approach. Demonstrate that a line-to-ground fault on a single phase, or formation of said fault, can be detected and located by the prototype system. The goal is to detect, locate, and correct the first fault before a second occurs in a different location on the same phase; therefore, a safe method for insertion of faults at known locations may be required for testing. \r\n\r\nDetermine if the solution will be effective at the voltage and current levels required. Fault detection and location results will be verified against requirements to confirm that the technology can reliably sense faults and estimate their position(s). Include preliminary calculation of false positive and false negative rates using the prototype system. Accuracy, resolution, sensitivity and other metrics will be assessed as deemed necessary. \r\n\r\nConsider human factors, including how to best illustrate the presence and location of faults on a display so that maintainers understand where to go to resolve the issue. The graphical user interface should be easy to read, interact with, and understand. Validate that faults are indicated in an acceptable manner that may be integrated into existing systems.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate solution at NAWCAD Lakehurst test site using a representative model that meets actual power requirements. Conduct extensive testing that includes all viable fault modes and locations, i.e., test ground faults in pertinent cable sections as detailed by SMEs (Subject Matter Experts). After detecting faults, use a secondary method (e.g., insulation resistance tester) to determine actual fault location and calculate percent error/accuracy of location measurement. If a fault is not present near the location specified within a certain distance threshold, it must be recorded as a false positive. Additionally, regular insulation resistance testing must continue to determine if any ground faults are going undetected. If so, these must be recorded as false negatives. Integrated Product Team (IPT) will determine accuracy and resolution requirements necessary for transition. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic may benefit private sector companies working with high-power electricity in the energy, industrial and transportation sectors. This may include power generation, transmission and distribution, including both AC and DC (e.g., photovoltaic) applications, large manufacturing/industrial plant operations, and high-power railroad applications. Any commercial application that utilizes high power and experiences relatively low-fault currents, in comparison to operational currents, may benefit.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“MIL-STD-1399 (Section 300) Part 1, Department of Defense Interface Standard, Section 300, Part 1, Low Voltage Electric Power, Alternating Current (25-Sept-2018).” Department of Defense. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1300-1399/MIL-STD-1399-SECT-300_PART-1_55833/  \r\n\t“MIL-STD-461G, Department of Defense Interface Standard: Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment (11-Dec-2015).” Department of Defense. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0300-0499/MIL-STD-461G_53571/  \r\n\t“MIL-STD-810H, Department of Defense Test Method standard: Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests.” Department of Defense. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-810H_55998/  \r\n\t“MIL-DTL-901E, Detail specification: Shock Tests, H.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-004",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Optimally design and develop an innovative, affordable body armor release capability for Rotary Wing Naval Air Crew.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Combat rotorcraft operators strongly desire the capability to jettison negatively buoyant hard plates from their body armor in water survival situations without jettisoning their entire survival vest, especially in the event flotation fails to inflate. Hard plates are worn inside the vest and under gear, and usually load from the bottom which is then secured with hook/loop tape. Typical quick-release designs are gravity-based and rely upon the survivor to find and pull a strap to open the bottom. These gravity-based designs have been found to require multiple pulls and re-gripping the pull strap at ever higher positions to open the bottom. The hard plate’s downward drop is also resisted by the specific gravity of water, as well as frictional resistance from the tight, compressive fit of a heavy vest load. Pin-and-cable quick-releases in typical “maritime” or “marine” vests are an improvement over pull-strap with hook-and-loop designs, but often require complicated rigging and careful donning, which are not often compatible with rapid launch operations. Automatic quick-release mechanisms may work but can pose other hazards; an automatically released plate in a submerged aircraft will contribute to the debris field through which survivors must swim (crews can number up to 40 individuals). An automatic system can also rob the surfacing survivor of his ballistic protection in what may well be a combat environment. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is important that the hard plate release design avoid imposing additional dressed weight and bulk to the already burdened operator. In terms of dry weight, Crew Chiefs dressed in the summer combat configuration carry 52-60 additional pounds; most of it is carried on the front torso. The gear and armor load adds 3-6 inches to the front profile. Possible sources of confusion in an emergency are the round-beaded handle for flotation actuation, and the lozenge-beaded handle that releases the fall-arrest tether. These two releases are located near one another on the upper right and left chest. Although not required, it is highly recommended to work in coordination with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to ensure proper design and to facilitate transition of the final technology. \r\n\r\nAircrew need a hard plate release that, with commanded action and when retrofitted to existing vests that incorporate the ineffective gravity-based quick release, enable the below metrics. \r\n\r\na. releases a single hard plate with a single motion, only requiring one gloved left or right hand by a typical male or female, blind-folded operator; \r\n\r\nb. releases respective sizes of Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI)-cut, “shooter’s cut”, and “swimmer’s cut” hard plate forms; \r\n\r\nc. does not appreciably increase the weight and bulk burden of the armored vest system; \r\n\r\nd. operates in windy or calm air and in turbulent or calm water conditions; \r\n\r\ne. operates at a submerged depth of less than or equal to 30 feet; \r\n\r\nf. operates in cold water (32 degrees F) through the range of freshwater and seawater salinities; \r\n\r\ng. operates in chlorinated swimming pool water; \r\n\r\nh. operates reliably in cold and hot ambient air; \r\n\r\ni. separates the plate from the vest within 2 seconds of actuation; \r\n\r\nj. resists inadvertent actuation while: traversing ship ladders/hatches, operating within 120 knot rotor outwash, conducting pre-flight inspections and boarding aircraft, flying routine missions, flying combat missions, and egressing aircraft in routine or emergency situations; \r\n\r\nk. does not create hazards (injury, foreign object debris, snag/trip, static discharge) in any mission or survival operations to include survivable vertical crash loads (those less than or equal to 5Gs); \r\n\r\nl. does not interfere with vest or vest gear, inflatable flotation, seat harnesses, fall arrest tethers, helmets or head-mounted gear, communication cords and devices, clothing or other body-mounted gear; \r\n\r\nm. does not impede water survival or land survival procedures to include raft boarding and hoisting; \r\n\r\nn. does not contribute to wearer’s burn injury hazard; \r\n\r\no. does not give away wearer’s position in covert day or night operations; \r\n\r\np. is resistant to naval aviation environments (salt spray, humidity, drop impact, exposure to petroleum/oil/lubricant contaminants; exposure to sun); \r\n\r\nq. has an obvious visual indicator for correct rigging. \r\n\r\nNote: NAVAIR will provide Phase I performers with the appropriate guidance required for human research protocols so that they have the information to use while preparing their Phase II Initial Proposal. Institutional Review Board (IRB) determination as well as processing, submission, and review of all paperwork required for human subject use can be a lengthy process. As such, no human research will be allowed until Phase II and work will not be authorized until approval has been obtained, typically as an option to be exercised during Phase II. \r\n\r\nNote: Any textile components used to develop the resulting material must be entirely manufactured in the United States of constituents wholly grown and/or produced in the United States.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a plate release and demonstrate feasibility for retrofit and operation in any military approved commercial vest that incorporates a typical gravity-based quick release design. Resulting concepts should include a background section with explanatory figures describing the basic principles of the proposed technology concept, and publications or other references that outline the application being considered. Provide a 3-tiered work breakdown structure with a Gantt chart of Phase I design activities, and include make/break criteria and events. Submit Technical Performance Measures (TPMs) that will be tracked throughout Phases I-III for Government review and approval and include at a minimum: dry weight, bulk/profile, time from actuation to plate separation (from vest structure) while submerged in swimming pool water, human-operated reliability, and maintainer mean time to rig, inspect, and certify mechanism “safe-for-flight”. Provide experimental work that shows the technology concept will quickly release hard plates in air and in water by an operator with a single hand and a single action. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II. \r\n\r\nNote: Please refer to the statement included in the Description above regarding human research protocol for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and validate the plate release technology by incorporating it into a Government-identified vest system design. Provide a detailed, 3-tiered work breakdown structure with a Gantt chart of Phase III activities that include make/break criteria and events, perform required quality assurance testing utilizing approved quality assurance measures, and track performance against agreed upon TPMs throughout Phase II. During the Phase II Option, perform testing of the technology in the form of a system level demonstration while incorporated in multiple size small and size x-large armored vests in a swimming pool. Include, in this non-exclusive list of desired Phase II deliverables, raw data, photography and/or video recording, data recording sheets, documentation of test devices (manufacturer, model, serial, accuracy, calibration status, etc.), test reports, draft engineering drawings, an interface control document, and a performance specification. \r\n\r\nNote: Please refer to the statement included in the Description above regarding human research protocol for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize the developed armor plate release technology and provide a technical data package to include a performance specification, interface control document, and engineering drawings in accordance with military standards. Develop and assist with required qualification testing and training. Finalize all testing. Document the quality assurance test program in accordance with industry best practices. Transition the technology to the Fleet as a retrofit, and to new procurements as required. \r\n\r\nThis topic may benefit the private sector in recreational equipment for which quick divestment of structure-mounted or body-mounted gear carriers are desirable or required for safety. Examples may include boat deck go-bags, back-packs, tool vests for workers at height, and tool vests for oil rig workers.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKovach, G. “Deadly Osprey crash spurred safety changes.” The San Diego Tribune, June 30, 2015. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sdut-osprey-crash-at-sea-command-investigation-2015jun30-story.html  \r\n\tQuinn, R. “Beach Marine one of four killed in Iraq copter crash.” The Virginian Pilot, December 7, 2006. https://www.pilotonline.com/military/article_57e53572-0cf4-5301-a6d0-2901302a4bb5.html\r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Battlespace Environments; Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and develop a packaged, high-throughput, non-mechanical beam steering device that is able to maintain stable operation with multiple-wavelength laser sources in the midwave infrared (MWIR) band with high beam quality, efficiency, and power on target.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) has numerous advantages over conventional mechanical gimbals, including high point-to-point steering speeds, low size, weight, and power consumption, and low operating costs. To date, NMBS devices have primarily been developed and matured in the short-wave and near-infrared bands. Recent advances in refractive NMBS technology have resulted in MWIR-compatible liquid crystal-based refractive devices [Refs 1, 2], but they have primarily been demonstrated at the laboratory scale and require additional development for Department of Defense (DoD) applications. Of particular interest is development of robust packaging for refractive NMBS devices that combines the steering head, associated optical components, and thermal management in a compact package that is able to operate from room temperature to beyond 55 degrees C, using the latest MIL-STD 810 for thermal testing. Additional considerations include optical optimization of refractive NMBS devices to improve throughput performance and steering magnitude. \r\n\r\nDriven by DoD application requirements, the Navy seeks development of technologies capable of continuously steering a beam across the field of regard (FOR) without blind spots. Steerers should satisfy specifications including, but not limited to: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tpoint-to-point steering speed: Threshold of 1 kHz (1 ms point-to-point transition time) across >75% of the FOR, Objective of 10 kHz (100 µs point-to-point transition time) for >75% of the FOR; \r\n\tangular steering range: Threshold of 15° horizontally by 2° vertically, Objective of 30° horizontally by 5° vertically; \r\n\tthroughput: Threshold of 30%, Objective of 50%; and \r\n\tpower-on-target: Threshold of >1 W, Objective of >10 W; \r\n\tbeam quality: Threshold of M2 <5, Objective of M2<1.5;\r\n\taperture: Threshold of 2 mm, Objective of 1 cm;\r\n\ttotal packaged beam steerer volume (including associated coupling optics and thermal management): Threshold of <50 cm3, Objective of <10cm3; and\r\n\telectrical power consumption of the steerer head and associated thermal management while under active illumination: Threshold <10 W, Objective <1 W.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is desired that the full angular steering range be accessible without any wavelength-based steering effects, solutions that incorporate wavelength-tuning methods may be considered. The steerer must be capable of transitioning between any arbitrary points within the FOR and holding position at any arbitrary point; the primary operation mode necessary to achieve threshold and objective specifications should not be a continuous raster scan. The designed device must be able to accommodate coupling and steering of multiple laser lines, individually, but in a single device, between 2-5µm with high efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe design should reasonably expect to achieve a manufacturing readiness level (MRL) of 5 within 3 years and MRL 7 within 5 years of beginning work on this NMBS device.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of refractive NMBS waveguides for improved optical performance, to include designs for improved steering while minimizing total optical path length. Designs for packaging of such a device should also be considered, taking into account thermal management and optical coupling of remoted lasers. An assessment of whether the proposed technology functions in reverse, as a scannable receiving optic, should be included. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II. A schedule and explanation of the manufacturing readiness level shall be included in the Phase I final report.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a packaged NMBS prototype device from the proposed design. Demonstrate that it is capable of maintaining stable operating temperature while meeting radiant power and M2 requirements. Include, in this demonstration, provisions to steer, either simultaneously or in rapid sequence, multiple wavelengths in the MWIR band. Ensure that volume and electrical power requirements apply to the prototype device.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Perform final testing the packaged NMBS device in a relevant environment, to include appropriate integration as applicable to the specific Navy platform. Transition and integrate to an airborne platform of interest chosen in consultation with PMA-272. \r\n\r\nThis technology is beneficial for medical diagnostics, chemical sensing, and other applications that utilize mid-infrared spectroscopy. Additionally, non-traditional beam steering may have lidar applications if the technology transitions the wavelength used in the lidar system.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFrantz, J.A.; Myers, J.D.; Bekele, R.Y.; Spillmann, C.M.; Naciri, J.; Kolacz, J.; Gotjen, H.G.; Nguyen, V.Q.; McClain, C.C.; Shaw, L.B. and Sanghera, J.S. “A chip-based non-mechanical beam steerer in the midwave infrared.” Journal of the Optical Society of America B, 35(12), 2018, pp. C29-C37. https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.35.000C29  \r\n\tMyers, J.D.; Frantz, J.A.; Spillmann, C.M.; Bekele, R.Y.; Kolacz, J.; Gotjen, H.; Naciri, J.; Shaw, B. and Sanghera, J.S. “Refractive waveguide non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) in the MWIR [Paper presentation].” Proceedings of SPIE OPTO 10539, Photonic Instrumentation Engineering V, San Francisco, CA, United States, January 27-February 1 2018. https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2290379 \r\n\r\n",

Upon deployment of a missile, the available fuel is ignited; and the combustion pressure that develops is funneled through the nozzle assembly. The throat, a critical component of the nozzle, is located near the exhaust end of the motor case. The nozzle diameter is intentionally reduced here in order to alter the flow and maximize performance. \r\n\r\nThe science of combustion of a solid fuel system is highly complex and it is believed that complete combustion of metal additives could dramatically increase performance [Ref 1]. A substantial part of combustion energy is released during condensation of the gaseous metal suboxides. A significant portion of this energy can be emitted as a flux of light. It could constitute more than 50% of the overall energy produced during the combustion of metals [Ref 4]. This energy should be dissipated from the condensation zone in order to enhance condensation. The thermal conductivity [Ref 5] and jetness of the nozzle are major parameters that control the rate of energy dissipation. \r\n\r\nThe condensation of metal suboxides occurs concurrently with the exhaust gas expansion in the nozzle. As such, the latter should be thoughtfully designed in order to: \r\n\r\n(a) enable the most favorable conditions for condensation of gaseous metal suboxides into its condensed oxide form, \r\n\r\n(b) accommodate the majority of condensation energy, and \r\n\r\n(c) withstand a radiative heat flux of high intensity formed as a result of a localized light emission subsequent to condensation of gaseous metal suboxides. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to design and develop efficient near-throat controlled cooling technologies that enhances heat removal, and therefore enhances condensation of gaseous metal suboxides. The manufacturing materials of the nozzle assembly must be able to withstand temperatures of combustion gasses on the order of 3000 K, high-radiative heat fluxes (greater than 10 MW/m2 [Ref 8]) caused by intense emissions of light, erosion, stress, thermal shock [Refs 2, 3], and other factors involved in the operation of a solid fuel rocket engine. The legacy materials are mostly based on specialty carbons, such as a carbon-carbon composite, or isostatically molded graphite [Refs 6, 7]. The proposed solution must meet all of the properties of the standard carbon materials to include, but not be limited to, to withstand erosion, stress, and thermal shock. Additionally, the throat insert must have controlled material properties such as thermal conductivity and jetness, so that it can remove heat from the condensing gas and from associated light emission at an ultrahigh rate, at least 10% more efficiently than the traditional materials.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design and develop a numeric model for the purpose of tuning the throat nozzle assembly’s material properties to induce a more efficient condensation near the throat. Initial prefeasibility studies with newly fabricated materials should be undertaken at the bench scale level. Deliver a prefeasibility report that outlines the results from the model and the delineation of nozzle assembly properties, which should at the very least, meet the performance characteristics of existing standard throat nozzle assembly materials at the end of Phase I. Outline a plan for improvement of material properties. Include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Demonstrate that the new materials will be at least 10% more efficient at withdrawing heat from condensing gases and light emission sources. Qualitative modeling will be used to estimate exactly how the prototype parts would benefit the thrust. All other physical and chemical properties of throat assembly will be at the same performance level as standard throat assembly materials. Perform testing to validate the technology can withstand stress, shock, and erosion.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize and mature the technology for transition and integration into surface-to-air and air-to-surface munitions, mobile targets, and space vehicle programs. Solid rocket fuel engines are heavily employed by various branches of the U.S. Navy, other branches of the DoD, and NASA to include commercial space exploration missions. Other applications include, but are not limited to, industrial uses for high-density electrically conductive graphite used in refractories, reactor components, and specialty liners for chemical vessels. Another application would be in industrial burners and in the design of exhaust of elevated temperature combustion engines, to include automotive applications.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBalas, S. and Natan, B. “Boron oxide condensation in a hydrocarbon-boron gel fuel ramjet.” American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., Journal of Propulsion and Power, 32(4), February 24, 2016, pp. 967-974. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35928  \r\n\tEssel, J.T.; Acharya, R.; Sabourin, J.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design, build, and demonstrate on-chip hyperspectral focal plane array, with integration of dynamically tunable metamaterial lens to perform and produce 2D spatial images with a single exposure at a few selected wavelength bands instead of 1D spatial and all spectral band images.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) provides the means to detect targets smaller than the size of a pixel using spectral unmixing techniques. HSI contains hundreds of bands of spectral information per pixel. HSI is traditionally performed using a dispersive (prism or grating) reimaging system with a slit and focal plane array (FPA) at the conjugate image planes. Current HSI state-of-the-art detectors are based on various photon-to-electron conversion principles that, at best, have quantum efficiencies (QE) of 40 percent in the blue spectrum. Since the conversion process is substantially less than unity, additional laser power is required from the transmitter to make up for the loss of signal on the detector. If a photo detector type material with near unity QE could be used, the HSI system performance would dramatically increase with no additional laser power. The very high efficiency of metamaterial photodetectors will dramatically increase the electrical power available for electric small Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV). Improvements in photo detection efficiencies are sought to advance the tactical capabilities of HSI systems used on UAVs. \r\n\r\nOptical metamaterials with negative refractive index behavior have extraordinary promise in HSI applications. Unlike a conventional lens, a negative refractive index implies that when a material refracts an incoming light ray, the refracted ray will be deviated at a negative angle to the normal according to Snell&#39;s law. This seemingly trivial observation has profound consequences: focusing can be accomplished by a slab of material instead of a conventionally-shaped lens. More subtly, lenses made from negative index metamaterials (NIMs) can be much more compact than curved optical lenses such as cylindrical and aspheric lenses, since wave vector components along the optical axis can be used for imaging. In conventional optics, these components typically decay at distances very close to the lens surface (the near field), and account for a loss of imaging information, and ultimately, resolution. For a NIM, that decaying evanescent wave instead grows, allowing near-field resolution to extend into the far field. Furthermore, a negative index implies that the phase of a wave decreases, rather than advances, through the metamaterial NIM. A material with n = -1 can be considered to reverse the effect of propagation through an equivalent thickness of a vacuum. Consequently, NIMs have a potential advantage to form highly efficient low reflectance surfaces by exactly canceling the scattering properties of other materials. If the NIM is isotropic, then these effects occur regardless of the direction of the incident wave. \r\n\r\nNIMs require negative values of both the electrical permittivity (e) and magnetic permeability (µ). Negative permittivity is common in metals at optical frequencies, but negative permeability does not occur naturally; therefore, the construction of metamaterials involves engineering an effective negative permeability using nonmagnetic materials. This can be done by including electromagnetically resonant structures. Optical-frequency resonators are much smaller in scale (< 1 mm), have been recently made with advanced lithographic procedures, and have shown negative index behavior in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Still, these NIMs are not isotropic as the features are planar, and the index varies with orientation. Additionally, most of them have large optical losses due to the materials that comprise them. \r\n\r\nA quick examination of NIM literature reveals that in most cases where a metamaterial lens would be used to create images, the refractive index should be independent of direction of the incoming radiation. Yet, the properties of most NIMs reported in the literature are not randomly dispersed inclusions, are not dependent on random orientation of crystal grains, and are not inherently isotropic in three dimensions. \r\n\r\nThe primary challenge in NIMs is advancing the diffraction limit in Near Field capabilities to identify a threshold to separate targets from clutter in hyperspectral data idiosyncrasies. Hence, NIM designs need to provide larger phase shifts and reduce aberrations to enable tuning the focal length with adjustable sequential metamaterial lens structures, resulting in low far-field resolution of features beyond the diffraction limit in the visible spectrum. Highly viable/manufacturable single and sequential metamaterial lens designs addressing the 3-12 µm spectral range with a focus on 3-5 and 8-12 microns are a possible solution. \r\n\r\nNIM lens system parameters for trade analysis are: \r\n\r\n(a) Operational spectral range @ 3-12 microns; \r\n\r\n(b) Smallest Spectral sampling step @ 1 nm; \r\n\r\n(c) Spectral resolution @ full-width half maximum (FWHM) @ 7–10 nm; \r\n\r\n(d) Spectral Stability @ < 1 nm; \r\n\r\n(e) Wavelength switching speed @ < 2 ms; \r\n\r\n(f ) Incidence angle to the Fabry-Perot Cavity @ < 5° (max < 7°); \r\n\r\n(g) Average spectral transmission @ > 0.2; \r\n\r\n(h) Image size @ 480 x 750; \r\n\r\n(i) Dynamic range @ 10 bit; \r\n\r\n(j) F-number range of the optics @ 4.0 – 16.0; \r\n\r\n(k) Focal length @ 8–25 mm; \r\n\r\n(l) Field of View (FOV) @ 20° x 30°; \r\n\r\n(m) Object distance @ 0.05 m – Infinity; \r\n\r\n(n) Operational quantum efficiency @ >100% in the 3-12 microns spectral band; \r\n\r\n(o) Noise factor @ < 1.1; \r\n\r\n(p) Bandwidth @ > 100 MHz; \r\n\r\n(q) Fast response speed@ (rise time tr < 68 µs); \r\n\r\n(r) Uniform optical quality in terms of refractive index and extinction co-efficient; \r\n\r\n(s) Root Mean Square (RMS) errors below 1×10-3 refractive index units (RIU) \r\n\r\n(t) Weight @ < 350 g; \r\n\r\n(u) Thickness @ 0.2 to 0.5 mm (ultrathin with < wavelength (lambda) divided by 8 surface flatness); \r\n\r\n(v) Active areas on the order of 1 to 2 inches in diameter; and \r\n\r\n(w) Focusing performance for oblique incidence with an incident angle up to 15 degrees.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct research and experiments to determine potential NIMs for HSI NIM lens and select optimum technical approach using the system parameters for trade. Develop preliminary design and perform detailed analysis for on-chip hyperspectral focal plane arrays, with integration of dynamically tunable NIM lens to allow for spectral reconstruction with a single photodetector; and to be directly integrated with arbitrarily-sized read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) for real-time HSI in-pixel image processing. Preliminary design should also include an integrated/embedded metamaterial structure that can be easily subjected to change in temperature or to stress loads while interrogated by electromagnetic fields. Through experimentation, identify NIM technical risk elements in the HSI metamaterial lens and provide viable risk mitigation strategies. The Phase I effort will include on-chip hyperspectral focal plane arrays, with integration of dynamically tunable NIM lens prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine the design based on outcomes of simulated data, boot strap error analysis, tests and customer feedback in Phase I. Develop, demonstrate, and validate an HSI metamaterial lens prototype in the lab, chamber, and/or field. Demonstrate and validate the prototype system with all of the parameters identified in Phase I. Prepare a report that summarizes the experimental evaluation and validation of the performance characteristics of the developed system.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Complete prototype hardware that will cover operational spectral range@ 300 – 1200 nm. Fully develop and transition the technology and methodology based on the research and development results developed during Phase II for DOD applications in the areas of UAVs detection and identification, and other anomaly surveillance and reconnaissance applications. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic has direct relevance to commercial private sector airborne remote sensing companies engaged in environmental monitoring, agriculture assessments and exploration of natural resources due to the system’s compact form factor, flexible flight profiles and precision identification, and change/anomaly detection. \r\n\r\nLower cost hyperspectral sensors for agriculture, land use, search/rescue, and homeland security could employ this technology. The use of low-cost solution-based metamaterials and their ability to be directly integrated with arbitrarily-sized ROICs results in HSI cameras that can be produced at a small fraction of the cost of traditional camera systems.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAieta, F.; Genevet, P.; Kats, M.A.; Yu, N.; Blanchard, R.; Gaburro, Z. and Capasso, F. “Aberration-Free Ultrathin Flat Lenses and Axicons at Telecom Wavelengths Based on Plasmonic Metasurfaces.” American Chemical Society, Nano Letters, 12(9), August 15, 2012, pp. 4932-4936. https://doi.org/10.1021/nl302516v  \r\n\tAieta, F.

"topic_title": "Tool to Predict Transient Spatial-Temporal Boundary Conditions for Processing Autoclave-cured Composite Parts",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-008",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design, develop, and validate an analytical tool to accurately predict the local transient thermal and mechanical boundary conditions during the processing of composite parts within an autoclave.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Autoclaves are widely used to process and cure high quality parts for composite structural components used on aircraft. This high quality is possible due to the autoclave’s high internal pressures and ability to apply high temperatures in excess of 350°F such that the intended resin systems can cure. When these assumed conditions are not met, defects such as porosity and poor fiber consolidation occur [Ref 5]. Autoclave systems are designed with these conditions in mind, but since part thickness, tool geometry, and part location can vary from run to run, the local conditions cannot be guaranteed. The conditions within are driven by the capabilities of the autoclave: air temperature, air flow and physical part geometry interaction with the tooling surface and vacuum bagging [Ref 6]. This environment is thus governed by a variety of physical interactions and requires a multiphysics modeling tool to accurately capture the boundary conditions experienced by the composite parts. \r\n\r\nModeling and simulation to predict composite part quality within an autoclave requires a coupling of the local boundary conditions with the mechanics and chemistry going on within the composite. The temperature of the part at the bag as well as the tooling surface is critical to couple with the cure kinetic models [Ref 4]. Boundary conditions are usually assumed in simple models where the air temperature throughout the autoclave is believed homogenous and the part is experiencing perfect hydrostatic pressure regardless of location or tool geometry. Without accurate boundary conditions, anticipating defects or reducing internal stresses and spring-back is very difficult to predict accurately [Ref 1]. Current modeling capabilities often utilize simplistic two-dimensional models or assumed boundary conditions [Ref 7]. The means to expand that to more complex three dimensions are commercially available but limited. Accurate modeling of the environment within the autoclave can be computationally expensive and require responsive software simulation integration to capture multi-physics interactions [Ref 2]. Hybrid models utilize a variety of physics including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer which then feed into the boundary conditions for cure kinetic models. These models also require experimental validation from actual autoclave runs which can be difficult since each commercial autoclave system is unique [Ref 10]. This is where data fusion from in-situ monitoring can be used not only to validate but to tune a model for predicting boundary conditions. The goal of this SBIR topic is to provide a means to integrate both modeling capabilities as either a single tool or an add-on to existing software. This software tool will have validation from real-life autoclave runs and the means to be adapted to various autoclave systems per the user’s need. \r\n\r\nMany of the current methods for running parts in an autoclave come from simple models, best practices and extensive thermal surveys to confirm that the material has cured as intended. Autoclave runs completed in early acceptance testing feature parts that are outfitted with a multitude of sensors to measure temperatures throughout the part and tool. The temperature and pressure cycle is then adjusted until the desired cure profile is achieved throughout the part. Temperature ramp rates and early cycle dwell periods are critical to removing volatiles from the liquid resin and facilitating flow. Final cure temperatures and duration confirm that the resin has solidified and reached complete cure at every location in the composite part. Design engineers must intelligently place multiple tooling and parts within the autoclave such that the air flow is not blocked [Ref 3]. Any great change to this process must be preceded with another thermal survey and part inspection teardown. Having a multiphysics software tool capable of modeling the system’s boundaries would reduce the amount of expensive autoclave runs needed to start production. It can also provide production lead time flexibility since the operator can intelligently position multiple parts within the autoclave and still achieve the correct cure profile for each. When there are indications from Non Destructive Inspection (NDI), the software can then be run to assess problem areas within the cure as well as provide the operator feedback that the autoclave may be out of its designed thermal and pressure specification. The benefits of this software tool will allow engineers faster entry into production, gain flexibility in production stream through curing various part combinations and more rapidly assess problems that would later manifest themselves as part defects. Software simulations tools will reduce the number of test runs required for opening up a new composite part production run. They will also enable greater production scheduling freedom through process modeling of part layouts within autoclaves, which will make production more adaptive and save scheduling time and thus cost.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Propose a concept of a multiphysics tool that can address the local non-uniform transient thermal and mechanical boundary conditions accounting for conditions within an autoclave. Demonstrate the concept and quantify the effects of non-uniform environmental conditions via a numerical simulation of airflow temperature, pressure and heat transfer for a simple composite part during autoclave processing.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Enhance and develop the proposed concept prototype tool to address the manufacturing of composite parts containing inserts, complex curvatures, and thick laminates exceeding 1.5 inches in thickness. Validate the prototype tool by comparing simulation results to a live autoclave run containing a variety of composite parts and tooling with select geometries. Capture transient thermal and pressure distributions through in-situ monitoring to be then compared to simulation results. Demonstrate the ability to use this prototype tool coupled with a cure kinetics model for a chosen material system. Verify that this prototype tool can be used on a variety of autoclave systems and part/tool load-outs. Provide the developed prototype software tool for the Navy to use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition this software tool to the program and production. Optimize this tool for difficult-to-process parts and layouts that have historically hindered production due to defects and warpage from incorrect autoclave heating. \r\n\r\nThe product outcome of this SBIR topic has extensive applications for companies producing autoclaved composite parts as well as other industrial processes that require the controlled enclosed heating and pressurization of a product. Software simulations tools will reduce the number of test runs required for opening up a new composite part production run. They will also enable greater production scheduling freedom through process modeling of part layouts within autoclaves. This will make production more adaptive and save scheduling time and thus cost. Secondary applications extend to any enclosed processing of a product using convective heating and external pressure. This includes, but is not limited to, heat treatment of metal, ceramic, and glass products as well as baked goods.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBaran, I.; Cinar, K.; Ersoy, N.; Akkerman, R. and Hattel, J. “A review on the mechanical modeling of composite manufacturing processes.” Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 24(2), January 20, 2016, pp. 365-395. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11831-016-9167-2  \r\n\tDumont, F.; Fröhlingsdorf, W. and & Weimer, C. “Virtual autoclave implementation for improved composite part quality and productivity.” CEAS Aeronautical Journal, 4(3), September 2013, pp. 277-289. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13272-013-0072-1  \r\n\tMaffezzoli, A. and Grieco, A. “Optimization of parts placement in autoclave processing of composites.” Applied Composite Materials, 20(3), June 2013, pp. 233-248. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10443-012-9265-8  \r\n\tMesogitis, T.; Skordos, A. and Long, A. “Stochastic simulation of the influence of cure kinetics uncertainty on composites cure.” Composites Science and Technology, 110, April 6, 2015, pp. 145-151. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compscitech.2015.02.009  \r\n\tPotter, K. “Understanding the origins of defects and variability in composites manufacture [Paper presentation].” Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Composite Materials.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Research and address the holistic cyber threat posed by the transfer of aeronautical data to Navy and United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft by taking physical avionics data inputs to the aircraft and developing solutions to harden those input channels, protecting the data from malicious tampering and errant corruption.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Critical aeronautical data is transferred into avionics systems to provide pilot guidance or other information used to influence pilot decisions in the cockpit. This aeronautical data may include the navigation database, vertical obstruction database, flight plans, world magnetic model, maps, and imagery. To prevent malicious tampering of this data, cyber protection needs to be implemented on all physical avionics data inputs in these airborne systems. Currently, minimal cyber-safe mechanisms are offered and only provide protection against errant corruption. No complete cyber protection set exists for the physical avionics data inputs creating a multitude of threat surfaces to be addressed. The Navy must fully identify all threat surfaces and begin to prototype protections against those threats. The following are examples of physical data threat surfaces (but by no means intended to be a complete list): \r\n\r\nCorrupt/Invalid Source –involves the data validity of the data sourced by the data provider (Government, industry, or open-sourced); could be a result of any other type of threat surface. \r\n\r\nErrant Corruption –a non-intentional data corruption introduced by human or computer error; also the most easily identified by mechanisms such as Cyclical Redundancy Checks (CRCs). \r\n\r\nProposed approaches should include, but not be limited to, a white hat analysis of all physical avionics data inputs to all Navy and USMC aircraft. For each physical avionics data input this research should identify the data flow which includes data source, transitional systems (e.g., tablet, Navy/Marine Corps Internet (NMCI), Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), maintenance computer), and end use. For each data flow, perform a human factors assessment to determine if the pilot decision making based on operational conditions (e.g., instrument flight rules (IFR) vs visual flight rules (VFR), approach vs cross country) and alteration of data inputs can be altered. Potential mitigation strategies should be identified for each physical avionics data input. These mitigation strategies could be process, software, or hardware solutions depending on the scenario. An evaluation of current protections, postulate new or enhanced cyber protections, and perform experimentation to determine if protections are sufficient to mitigate risk should be performed. All postulated solutions should focus on performance of the solution to prevent unnecessary burden on the aircrew that could prevent them from attaining mission success. \r\n\r\nUtilizing the white hat analysis, firms should develop prototype solutions for the two platforms with the largest threat surface in order to provide a formal design, implementation, and formal qualification testing of protection strategies for the data chain from source to end use. Prototype solutions in this context could be hardware, software, and/or procedural guidance. To validate the initial threat surface analysis and protections implemented provide sufficient protections to avert any corrupt/invalid source, errant corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), or spoofing/hacking attack types, potential technologies will participate in a focused ethical hacking event (or Hack-a-thon). A successful demonstration of the prototype solutions would be the prevention of all attempts to infiltrate the system and successful identification and notification of operators of hazardously misleading information that would affect decisions within the cockpit. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) formerly Defense Security Service (DSS). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances. This will allow contractor personnel to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVAIR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine feasibility of proposed approach by performing a white hat analysis of all physical avionics data inputs to all Navy aircraft. Provide a summary of the white hat analysis, a listing of all threat surfaces, the affected aircraft, mitigation strategies, and residual risk while also identifying gaps where analysis was non-deterministic. In the Phase I option, if exercised, develop a threat brief deployable to each platform and a Business Case Analysis (BCA). The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate prototyping solutions for the two platforms with the largest threat surface. Provide a formal design, implementation, and formal qualification testing of protection strategies for the data chain from source to end use. Prototype solutions in this context could be hardware, software, and/or procedural guidance. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize prototype solutions and validate at a focused ethical hacking event (or Hack-A-Thon). Proofing of threat patches, if high priority topics are discovered, additional or iterative hacking events may occur to ensure completion of targeted topics (i.e., fly-fix). Transition and integrate the deployment of cyber protection strategies to naval platforms or Programs of Record. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this topic will result in a packaged set of methodologies to protect data in transit from off-aircraft maintenance stations to on-aircraft usage to protect against both errant and malicious corruptions. Those methodologies could in turn be documented and shared with the private sector for use on Navy projects. Both the commercial sector (such as GE, Jacobs, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, L3Harris) and other DoD services could benefit from a deployed base cyber protection suite of tools. Software, hardware, and procedural solutions would need to remain portable to multiple environments to support reuse of tools and methodologies.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“DO-200B, Standards for Processing Aeronautical Data.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments; Human Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative and cost-effective Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System that can provide ready relevant training and encourage student participation through gamification of learning arcade style activities, with integrated student and class metrics that can increase training efficiency can address that need. This capability will provide a level of training fidelity that the community has not experienced while reducing training time and cost.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Those resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Available on-demand, cloud environments are scalable and allow agencies to provision resources as required. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to investigate a Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System that leverages ready relevant learning and game theory. The system should allow remote access to a wide range of exercises and resources for students, instructors, and management. Consistent with the Cloud First policy, agencies will use cloud infrastructure when planning new mission and support applications. Additionally, agencies will consolidate existing applications to help reduce training time. In addition, one of the focus areas is improving training quality. \r\n\r\nReady Relevant Learning (RRL) is about driving fundamental changes into our approach to Sailor training. The goal of RRL is to provide the right training at the right time in the right way. To accomplish this, the Navy will modernize training to maximize impact and relevance, and accelerate processes for delivering new training to the Fleet. In order to improve Sailor performance and enhance mission readiness, the Navy’s industrial-era, conveyer-belt training model will transform into a modern version. The modern version will contain content that meets Fleet-validated learning needs [Ref 7]. \r\n\r\nGamification [Ref 5] is the process of defining the elements that make games fun and motivate players to continue playing while using those same elements in a non-game scenario to influence behavior [Ref 4]. For an educational scenario, some examples of gamification of desired student behavior include attending class, focusing on meaningful learning tasks, and taking initiative [Ref 6]. \r\n\r\nSome elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include, but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n(a) progress mechanics (points/badges/leaderboards); \r\n\r\n(b) narrative and characters; \r\n\r\n(c) player control; \r\n\r\n(d) immediate feedback; \r\n\r\n(e) opportunities for collaborative problem solving; \r\n\r\n(f) scaffolded learning with increasing challenges; \r\n\r\n(g) opportunities for mastery, and leveling up; and \r\n\r\n(h) social connection. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System should consist of networked Tower and Radar Trainer, and a Part-task computer-based trainer that has access to training modules on the cloud. More specifically, this effort seeks to investigate a Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System allowing remote access to a wide range of exercises and resources for students, instructors, and management. The system should have the ability to remotely observe the simulator from anywhere in the world via the internet providing users the ability to simulate, simultaneously, operations of multiple Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities such as multiple ATC approach control radars and multiple ATC towers operating in one given airspace. This ability should allow tower and radar controllers to simultaneously train using the same aircraft, handoffs, etc. to allow for a more realistic training scenario. Interactive development tools that allow for quick and easy creation of accurate scenarios can be immediately deployed to the cloud and used in full simulators and part-task trainers in all locations. Ready Relevant training via flexible part-task trainers that can be adapted to any curriculum aspect to provide targeted in-class training and off-class self-training reinforcement in all stages of student development for immediate implementation via the cloud trainer shall encourage student participation through gamification of learning arcade style activities with competitive scoreboards. If accessible via Department of the Navy (DON) networks, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net), and the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), comprehensive class, student, and exercise management tools, exercises and databases can be shared with all sites. The system should be able to quickly and easily identify problem topics for individuals and the whole class to effectively target instruction and deploy ATC training software across the enterprise.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Identify and demonstrate feasibility of a Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System that leverages RRL and game theory; and simulates, simultaneously, operations of multiple Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities such as multiple ATC approach control radars and multiple ATC towers, operating in one given airspace. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a functional Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System prototype with the ability to communicate via DON networks, the NMCI, the ONE-Net and the MCEN. The prototype of the software technology that considers and adheres to Risk Management Framework guidelines to support cyber-security compliance in a lab or live environment. Install, integrate, test, train, validate, and deliver the Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System prototype.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Obtain management framework certification for an authority to operate within operational/training systems. Finalize, refine, and integrate the Cloud Based Air Traffic Control Training System and instructional tools within the training system environment. Transition the technology to a Naval Air Station via a Program Office. Examples of commercial industries that could benefit from this cloud based training include commercial airlines and corporate training. This SBIR topic provides benefits to the private sector by opening up a Navy use case for cloud based training. Although cloud based training has been used outside of the DoD, leveraging cloud based training for the DoD will add additional challenges because of network limitations and cyber security requirements. This solution can be used in the defense industry as the foundation for all future cloud based trainers.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKent, S. “From cloud first to cloud smart.” Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, 2019. https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#procurement  \r\n\t“Cloud smart strategy.” United States Department of the Interior.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop ping strategies, in a simulation environment, that provide optimized performance for multistatic active sonar fields with a target that actively seeks to evade detection by the sonar field.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: One of the challenging components for developing new sonar systems and improvements to them is collecting data so that the system is mature with robust performance in a wide variety of acoustic environments.  Execution of data gathering events requires large investments funding Navy personnel and assets. In order to reduce costs while developing a system, the Navy seeks to employ models and simulations to the maximum extent possible reducing the need for a large number of data gathering events. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to develop foremost ping strategies and signal and information processing techniques to optimize search performance that can be validated against a realistic target motion model in a simulation environment.  Development of the target motion model is required and that model should include techniques for the target to avoid detection when located in a multistatic active coherent (MSAC) wide area search field.  Real-world parameters such as the sound speed profile and bathymetry will be provided. A reactive target model that seeks to evade an active multistatic field and remain undetected will enable more meaningful simulation results of the ping strategies under evaluation and will better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed changes.  Historical approaches to the detection problem [Ref 7] focus on reconciling the sonar equation. The Navy seeks to develop ping strategies that leverage signal and information processing or other techniques in addition to just reconciling the sonar equation that will improve the probability of detection and show an improvement against a reactive target model that is able to maneuver, change speed, and change depth. Because the target has mass  (i.e., the size of a manned platform), instantaneous changes in speed or direction should not be considered in the target motion model. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may be classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) formerly known as Defense Security Service (DSS). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVAIR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Demonstrate the feasibility of ping strategies for a notional multistatic sonar system, which improves performance against an optimized reactive target model. Show that these new strategies improve performance versus a random ping schedule. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and implement ping strategies for a simulated MSAC field with a reactive target including broadband and narrowband waveforms, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) pinging, and high-duty cycle (HDC) pinging. Demonstrate that new ping strategies can successfully detect a reactive target 25% more often than simple ping schedules. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize and implement the capability as part of an operational sonar system. Transition of this capability should utilize the Advanced Product Builds (APB) process. The search techniques developed under this effort have application across the Navy for sonar, radar, electro-optic, and other sensor devices. \r\n\r\nThe searching or tracking of mobile targets where the sensors are stationary would benefit from this capability (i.e., tracking assets in an urban battlefield). A potential commercial application would be to the gaming industry especially if the object of the game was to avoid detection or capture.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tJackson, P. “Introduction to Expert Systems (3rd ed.).” Addison Wesley, 1998.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-012",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Battlespace Environments; Electronics\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and develop a miniature, low-cost, high-performance inertial navigation system based on novel micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope technology for improved performance and Space, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Department of the Navy (DON) has emphasized the need for aerial platforms to have GPS-independent position, navigation, and timing capability. In order to satisfy the position and navigational capability goals, more advanced inertial navigation systems (INS) are needed. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) based on MEM technology could be the key to obtaining this sought after INS capability. MEMS gyroscopes are gaining increased usage in commercial and military applications because of their low size, weight, and power characteristics; MEMS-based IMUs that are shock/vibration resistant have the potential to provide accurate GPS-independent position and navigation data. Recent advances in the construction of MEMS devices have made it possible to manufacture small and light IMUs. Improvements in MEM gyroscope technology include characteristics such as bias drift prediction, micro-capacitance sensing, structure-borne noise and vibration analysis, quality factor optimization, bandwidth expansion, data compensation, quadrature error correction, and ease of fabrication. The availability of new MEMS, such as the Double U-beam vibration ring gyroscope (DUVRG), have the potential to improve unaided INS performance while retaining the ability to operate in the harsh environments common to Navy aviation platforms. A number of DUVRG structures can be combined into a small area, with opposing temperature and noise sensitivities to offset errors, and their outputs averaged for improved drift rates. The Navy seeks vibration and shock resistant tactical grade IMU for inertial navigation that are less than 3 in³, (volume), 100g (weight), and 2.3W (power) with position/angle/angle rate errors of 0.2m/0.1°/.005° per hour or less. This SBIR topic seeks vibration and shock [Ref 1] resistant tactical grade IMU for inertial navigation that are less than 3 in3, (volume), 100g (weight), and 2.3W (power) with position/angle/angle rate errors of 0.2m/0.1°/.005° per hour or less.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility of the MEM gyroscope technology, including the use of DUVRGs in the design of a robust INS with state-of-the-art unaided drift characteristics. Determine how much improvement in position, pointing, roll and pitch accuracy can be obtained using advanced MEM gyroscope technology, and begin designing a DURVG-based (or other innovative MEM gyroscope) INS using modeling and/or analysis. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and validate a DUVRG-based or other innovative MEM gyroscope-based INS prototype. Perform bench level tests to verify the performance of prototype. Assess performance in a representative environment using MIL-STD-810 [Ref 1].\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Complete development of a MEM gyroscope-based INS prototype and demonstrate performance in an actual, operational environment. Integrate and transition to Navy hosting platforms.

"topic_number": "N211-013",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Biomedical; Human Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and develop a thermoregulatory control device to be worn in conjunction with maintainer, flight deck crew, and rotary-wing aircrew helmets to prevent overheating in hot climates and support continued mission operation without degradation in human performance for up to twelve hours.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Helmet systems have been developed to improve hearing and head protection in extremely loud environments [Refs 1-2]. Most of these helmets are unvented and some have an edge roll seal around the face and neck to improve hearing protection. Consequently, these features also create the potential for increased risk of overheating while wearing the helmet, especially in hot environments, over a 12-hour work period [Refs 3-4]. \r\n\r\nThe Department of the Navy (DoN) seeks thermoregulatory control devices to be worn in conjunction with maintainer, flight deck crew, and rotary-wing aircrew helmets. The proposed technology must prevent the potential overheating of maintainers, flight deck crew, and rotary-wing aircrew for up to 12 hours [Refs 5-7]. Cooling devices may be head, neck, or body mounted and worn in, or under, the current helmet system or clothing. The technology must not interfere with mission operation, nor should it cause a decline in human performance or hearing protection over a 12-hour period. Technologies must be portable, lightweight, and should integrate with current helmets or personal protective equipment without disruptions to the edge roll or shell of the helmet, which would degrade current levels of hearing protection. In addition, added weight on the head should not significantly change the center of mass so as to lead to discomfort or decreased performance, nor should the technology force the head into a forward pitch position. The desired system may include, but is not limited to, passive and active, evaporative, conductive, or convective cooling. The technology should have minimal components and no risk of accidental detachment during mission operations. The cooling must not introduce health or safety risks to the warfighter or the environment. Both a one-size-fits-all approach, as well as, specific solutions for each application will be considered. \r\n\r\nAlthough not required, it is highly recommended to work in coordination with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to ensure proper design and to facilitate transition of the final technology [Refs 1-2]. \r\n\r\nNAVAIR will provide Phase I performers with the appropriate guidance required for human research protocols so that they have the information to use while preparing their Phase II Initial Proposal. Institutional Review Board (IRB) determination as well as processing, submission, and review of all paperwork required for human subject use can be a lengthy process. As such, no human research will be allowed until Phase II and work will not be authorized until approval has been obtained, typically as an option to be exercised during Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop approaches to an innovative cooling solution that does not compromise hearing or head protection. Demonstrate proof of concept through test fixture testing and modeling. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II. \r\n\r\nNote: Please refer to the statement included in the Description above regarding human research protocol for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and produce a prototype thermoregulatory device based on the design developed in Phase I. Perform subject testing to evaluate performance in work-representative scenarios.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-014",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a scalable, real-time, predictive, and adaptive model-based test frame control system that increases load cycling frequency while maintaining load accuracy for high speed dynamic rotary wing airframe testing.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Full-scale fatigue testing is required for all new aircraft designs. While all aircraft are subjected to this testing, rotary wing aircraft often prove to be much more difficult to evaluate because of the high cycle counts that helicopter airframes experience. Currently, the limitations of structural testing control systems require full-scale fatigue tests to be performed at frequencies much lower than those generally experienced on rotary wing aircraft. Full-scale fatigue testing on rotary wing aircraft is typically limited to a low cycle fatigue test, where Ground-Air-Ground cycles and simplified maneuver loads are applied to the airframe. Truncation and/or equivalent damage methods are used to reduce the cycle count in order to perform a test within a reasonable time period. However, there is evidence that shows that equivalent damage methods, which remove high frequency load components at high mean stress loads, can produce unconservative crack growth rates. The crack growth rates are slower than what would be accumulated on an in-service aircraft, which creates a risk of not being able to find premature cracking at a representative time, or even at all during the full-scale fatigue test. Since pure cycle count reduction cannot produce test results that are consistent with real fleet usage, increasing testing speed is required to be able to incorporate more loading cycles without significantly prolonging a test effort. \r\n\r\nCurrent technology used in full-scale fatigue testing is limited to load cycle speeds of approximately 2 Hz, and most tests are practically slow enough to be considered quasi-static. At speeds this low, full-scale fatigue tests would take over 200 years to complete if all vibratory load content were to be included. The control system generally used for this testing is a reactive-style feedback loop that requires a load to be applied, usually by means of hydraulic servo-cylinders, and the system response to be read by sensors, such as strain gauges and load cells. Gains in the feedback loop are adjusted to provide satisfactory tracking between the target and measured loads or strains. While these reactive methods are adequate for quasi-static tests, they become insufficient as the frequency and speed of the test increases due to complexities caused by large airframe displacements, airframe inertial effects, actuator cross coupling, and phase lag caused by system response times. If these issues are unaddressed, the load cycling rate in a test will have to remain low in order for loads to be applied accurately. Accurate loads are required to attain representative test results to ultimately make a correct assessment of the actual life of the airframe, as well to catch and predict early cracking that might occur in the fleet. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks a model-based, or “model-in-the-loop”, control system for full-scale aircraft fatigue testing that can achieve higher cycling rates and faster test speeds compared to those achievable by current reactive control systems (0.5 Hz – 2 Hz). The control-system should be able to predict and generate the signals required for load application based on sensor data (including strain gauge bridges, load cells, displacement transducers) and a representative model of the system. This model could include the test article, fixtures, actuators, hydraulic valves and supply system, and sensors located on the test article or on the actuators. A peak loading frequency of at least 10 Hz is desired in order to match the primary loading frequencies on rotary-wing platforms. The control system should be capable of controlling high speed actuators that can achieve speeds in excess of 100 in/s in order to meet or exceed the frequency requirement while still being able to achieve displacements that may be several inches in magnitude. The controller should be able to simulate the test system in real time, use the model to predict required actuation signals, adapt the model and parameters to account for nonlinearities and uncertainties, and be scalable to handle multiple degrees of freedom with coupled actuations with potential for 15 or more actuators. \r\n\r\nCommercial and naval aircraft both face similar requirements for full scale fatigue testing. Improvements to testing speed while maintaining required loads and displacements would improve both cost and schedule for acquisitions and validation of new platforms. This technology could also improve dynamic testing in automotive applications, as well as for other ground-based military vehicles.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine feasibility of a real-time, predictive, and adaptive control system using a simplified test setup that leverages models of the test system in order to increase variable amplitude load accuracy at higher frequencies. Develop a plan for expanding the Phase I work into a prototype system that can be demonstrated on a simplified test article capable of increased test speeds and controlling multiple actuators.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a prototype model-based control system based on the Phase I approach by integrating the controller into a test that applies representative loads onto simplified test article that is representative of an airframe structure in order to show increased control system performance (i.e., speed and accuracy) against a traditional control system. Demonstrate the ability to handle the coupling of multiple actuators as seen in a full scale fatigue test.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop and demonstrate a modular and scalable model-based control system on a full scale fatigue test specimen using multiple actuators and combined vibratory/maneuver loading. Verify that the system can apply vibratory loads accurately at load cycling rates of 10 Hz or higher. \r\n\r\nBecause commercial and naval aircraft both face similar requirements for full scale fatigue testing, improvements to testing speed while maintaining required loads and displacements would improve both cost and schedule for acquisitions and validation of new platforms. This technology could also improve dynamic testing in automotive applications and for other ground-based military vehicles.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPlummer, A.R. “Model-in-the-Loop Testing.” Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 220(3), 2006, pp. 183-199. https://doi.org/10.1243/09596518JSCE207  \r\n\tHewitt, R.L. and Albright, F.J. “Computer modeling and simulation in a full-scale aircraft structural test laboratory.” ASTM International, Applications of Automation Technology to Fatigue and Fracture Testing and Analysis: Third Volume, 1997, pp. 32-33. https://doi.org/10.1520/STP11542S  \r\n\tMare, J.-C. “Dynamic loading systems for ground testing of high speed aerospace actuators.” Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 78(4), July 1, 2006, pp. 275-282. https://doi.org/10.1108/17488840610675546  \r\n\tPlummer, A.R. “Control techniques for structural testing: a review.” Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 221(2), March 2007, pp. 139-169. https://doi.org/10.1243/09596518JSCE295  \r\n\tCornelis, B.; Toso, A.; Verpoest, W. and Peeters, B. “Adaptive modelling for improved control in durability test rigs [Paper presentation].” Proceedings of the 20th International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 20), Bangkok, Thailand, July 7-11, 2013, pp. 507-516. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258440444_Adaptive_Modelling_for_improved_control_in_durability_test_rigs  \r\n\tSarhadi, P. and Yousefpour, S. “State of the art: hardware in the loop modeling and simulation with its applications in design, development and implementation of system and control software.” International Journal of Dynamics and Control, 3(4), June 10, 2014, pp. 470-479. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40435-014-0108-3  \r\n\tHu, J. and Plummer, A.R. “Compensator design for model-in-the-loop testing [Paper presentation].” 2016 UKACC 11th International Conference on Control (CONTROL), Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, August 31-September 1, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1109/CONTROL.2016.7737633 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Long-Wave Infrared Transceivers for High Speed Free Space Optical Communications in Adverse Weather Conditions",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-015",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Information Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop long-wave infrared transceiver components with high-data rate and low-bit error rate for use in free-space optical communications in adverse weather conditions.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Free-space optical (FSO) communication links provide high-data rate, low latency, secure wireless, mobile communication that are difficult to jam or intercept and do not require spectrum management. FSO communication is an especially compelling alternative to a radio-frequency (RF) link with external RF Interference (RFI) in a RF-denied environment. Most current proposed or deployed FSO systems are in the short wave Infrared (SWIR) regime at around 1.55 micrometers due to ubiquity of the laser and optical components customized for fiber optical communications. Exceptionally high data rates at this wavelength range are possible when atmospheric effects are not present [Ref 1], and laser-based FSO communication is the leading solution for interconnecting new constellations of low-earth-orbit satellites. Terrestrial FSO links have seen some success, but link budget in the SWIR regime is often limited by optical obscurants such as haze, fog, clouds, atmospheric absorption, and turbulence presence in the atmosphere. SWIR links with stabilized telescopes have been demonstrated to achieve gigabit per second (Gb/s) communication between naval vessels in ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore configurations at ranges of 12 and 45 kilometers (km) [Ref 2], despite the link limitation to 1 km when the visibility was impaired by heavy fog. For FSO laser communications systems operating in the SWIR bands, including 1300 nm and 1550 nm, the photonic wavelength is comparable to the size of aerosols that scatter and attenuate the laser beam propagation in the channel. \r\n\r\nRecent analysis has shown that operation in a more optimal long wave infrared (LWIR) wavelength range accessible from monolithic sources only via Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) enables dramatically lower attenuation from a variety of atmospheric effects [Ref 3]. The attenuation due to the presence of optical obscurants, such as fog, haze, and maritime aerosols for 10-micrometer (µm) wavelength transmission, is strikingly over 300 times lower than that at 1550 nm. Furthermore, LWIR FSO communication link at 10 µm wavelength have much reduced Rayleigh scattering compared to the 1.55 µm counterpart. At the same time, the fast carrier dynamics of QCLs make high-speed direct modulation possible [Ref 4], thereby also reducing transmitter complexity. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this SBIR topic is to develop the LWIR transceiver, including the laser for the transmitter and detector for the receiver to leverage the unique LWIR atmospheric transmission window that is more transparent than other wavelengths in adverse weather conditions. The adverse weather condition is defined as the atmospheric conditions where a 1.55 µm FSO link would suffer > 25dB attenuation due to multiple scattering caused by various hydrometeor types such as haze, clouds, fogs, and aerosols such as dusts, smoke, and pollens [Ref 1]. Current Fabry-Perot (FP) QCLs emitting in the 10-micron regime provide less than 1W single-facet continuous wave (CW) power with less than 5% efficiency [Ref 5]. Large QCLs have modulation bandwidths that are limited by the large device capacitance. Commercial distributed feedback (DFB) QCLs in this wavelength range emit less than 100 milliwatts, potentially limiting the FSO link budget. Innovative QCL designs are needed to increase the QCL room temperature CW output power while maintaining beam quality (M^2 < 1.5) and high reliability for the LWIR FSO system. \r\n\r\nThe Threshold and Objective parameters of QCL, detectors, and the transceivers are as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tQCL CW max power: Threshold of 250 mW, Objective of 1000 mW \r\n\tQCL wavelength: Threshold of 8.5-12 micron, Objective of 9.5-11.5 micron \r\n\tQCL linewidth: Threshold of 10 nm, Objective of < 2 nm \r\n\tDetector detectivity: Threshold of D* 2.25E9 cm* SQRT(Hz)/W, Objective of 5E9 cm* SQRT(Hz)/W \r\n\tDetector quantum efficiency: Threshold of 10%, Objective of 50% \r\n\tData rate (worse case conditions): Threshold of 1 Gb/s, Objective of 10 Gb/s \r\n\tData rate (clear conditions): Threshold of 10 Gb/s, Objective of 40 Gb/s \r\n\tAverage transmitter power: Threshold of 125 mW, Objective of 500 mW \r\n\tReceiver sensitivity at 1E-12 bit error rate (BER): Threshold of -18 dBm, Objective of -25 dBm \r\n\tReceiver saturation: Threshold of 1 mW, Objective of 10 mW \r\n\r\n\r\nCost-effective FSO links must function with devices’ temperatures near ambient (25 degrees C) to minimize cooling system cost, size, and power. At these temperatures, thermally induced dark current unacceptably limits detectivity of conventional LWIR photodetectors needed for the receiver side of the FSO link. Reducing detector volume reduces the dark current, but also the area and responsivity. Recent research has shown that metal and dielectric resonators can enhance the collection area and responsivity, enabling high detectivity in the LWIR near room temperature [Ref 6]. High detectivity has been demonstrated in devices based on both inter-band and inter-subband absorption, but innovative designs are certainly required to achieve both high speed and high receiver sensitivity simultaneously. \r\n\r\nFSO links based on LWIR QCLs and detectors operating at wavelengths optimized for highest system level performance will enable secure, mobile, naval communications in RF congested and denied environments. With the successful development of these critical LWIR components, a cost-effective and low space, weight, and power (SWaP) digital communication link that supports encryption with effective range over 100 km will be the objective of future development.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, develop, and demonstrate LWIR lasers and detectors needed for 10 Gb/s transmission for the adverse weather conditions [Ref 1]. The design should include plans for growth, fabrication, packaging processes, and a monolithic QCL transmitter emitting in the 10-micron wavelength region capable of 1W single facet CW operation and direct modulation bandwidth > 5 GHz. Detectors should have commensurate performance to enable the 10 Gb/s link. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and validate a prototype FSO link operating in the 10-micron region with at least 10 Gb/s data rate and BER of 1E-12 with 1 W average, single-spatial-mode transmitter launch power for the adverse weather conditions. Perform testing to explore the limits of operational speed and distance. Provide a production cost model.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize development of the prototype based on Phase II results for transition and integration into a Navy operational test asset. Conduct risk management and mitigation. \r\n\r\nTelecommunications and local, urban communications (communication nodes – line of sight) would benefit from this technology due to its high bandwidth capability even in adverse weather conditions.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRensch, D.B. and Long, R.K. “Comparative studies of extinction and backscattering by aerosols, fog, and rain at 10.6 µm and 0.63 µm.” Applied Optics, 9(7), 1970, pp. 1563-1573. https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.9.001563  \r\n\tCorrigan, P.; Martini, R.; Whittaker, E.A. and Bethea, C. “Quantum cascade lasers and the Kruse model in free space optical communication.” Optical Society of America, Optics Express, 17(6), 2009, pp. 4355-4359. https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.17.004355  \r\n\tBai, Y.; Bandyopadhyay, N.; Tsao, S.; Slivken, S. and Razeghi, M. “Room temperature quantum cascade lasers with 27% wall plug efficiency.” Applied Physics Letters, 98, 181102, May 2, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3586773  \r\n\tLee, B.G.; Belkin, M.A.; Audet, R.; MacArthur, J.; Diehl, L.; Pflüegl, C.; Capasso, F., Oakley, D.C.; Chapman, D.; Napoleone, A.; Bour, D.; Corzine, S.; Höefler, G. and Faist, J. “Widely tunable single-mode quantum cascade laser source for mid-infrared spectroscopy.” Applied Physics Letters, 91(23), December 3, 2007, pp. 231101-1–231101-3. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2816909  \r\n\tHofstetter, D.; Graf, M.; Aellen, T.; Faist, J.; Hvozdara, L. and Blaser, S. “23GHz operation of a room temperature photovoltaic quantum cascade detector at 5.35µm.” Applied Physics Letters, 89(6), August 10, 2006, pp. 061119-1–061119-3. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2269408  \r\n\tPalaferri, D.; Todorov, Y.; Bigioli, A.; Mottaghizadeh, A.; Gacemi, D.; Calabrese, A.; Vasanelli, A.; Li, L.; Davies, A.G.; Linfield, E.H.; Kapsalidis, F.; Beck, M.; Faist, J. and Sirtori, C. “Room-temperature nine-µm-wavelength photodetectors and GHz-frequency heterodyne receivers.” Nature, 556, March 26, 2018, pp. 85–88. https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25790  \r\n\tRodriguez, E.; Mottaghizadeh, A.; Gacemi, D.; Palaferri, D.; Asghari, Z.; Jeannin, M.; Vasanelli, A.; Bigioli, A.; Todorov, Y.; Beck, M.; Faist, J.; Wang, Q.J. and Sitori, C. “Room-Temperature, Wide-Band, Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector for Microwave Optical Links at 4.9 µm Wavelength.” ACS Photonics, 5(9), 2018, pp. 3689-3694. https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00704 \r\n\r\n",

When a vehicle is travelling through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 or higher, it encounters intense friction with the surrounding air. The nose cone and the leading edges of the flight vehicle will experience extremely high temperatures up to 3000 to 5000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). The extreme temperature of the leading edge caused by the kinetic heating is inversely proportional to the square root of its radius of curvature [Ref 1]. Therefore, the more aerodynamic the shape of the vehicle, the higher the temperatures of the leading edges. \r\n\r\nUltra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) materials, such as Hafnium carbide and Tantalum carbide [Ref 2], have extremely high melting points and high resistance to oxygen-induced ablation. Additionally, active research has been performed to develop these types of ceramics materials with mechanically and thermally robust structural and coating materials for hypersonic vehicles. Besides the thermal challenges of hypersonic vehicle exteriors, the extreme heat from the high-temperature external surfaces transported to the interior of the vehicle can impact performance and reliability of the internal systems, avionics and payloads. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to address the vehicle’s interior high-temperature challenges by developing and creating a lightweight, high-performance, materials and cooling system to insulate the exterior high temperature from the interior of the hypersonic vehicle. Any innovative passive or active thermal protection solution will be considered as long as it will maintain the internal ambient temperature of a hypersonic aerial vehicle at no more than 110 °F and the total weight is no more than 15% of the hypersonic aerial vehicle when empty [Ref 3]. The final hypersonic aerial vehicle shape and form will be determined at the beginning of the Phase I.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of the proposed lightweight thermal protection system for the hypersonic aerial vehicles. Conduct analytical and experimental models of the design. Determine any technical risks of the design and provide risk mitigation strategy. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Fully develop and optimize the approach developed in Phase I. Validate the lightweight thermal protection system’s performance via testing in a relevant representative hypersonic environment. Demonstrate that the lightweight thermal protection system can meet the performance requirements stated in the Description in a high-fidelity simulated aerothermodynamics heating for hypersonic flight environments [Ref 4].\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize development, based on Phase II results, for transition and integration of the product into a hypersonic vehicle candidate airframe. Conduct flight test units for fielding on Navy experimental flight tests. \r\n\r\nThis system could be applied to any commercial air vehicle, which must fly at high supersonic-to-hypersonic speeds (space access and recoverable vehicles). In addition, any low cost, high-temperature materials capable of surviving in a high-supersonic-flight environment would have diverse application in other industries that have components exposed to high temperatures, such as automotive engines, industrial processes, aircraft engines, airliner fuselages, industrial furnaces and confined electronics. Finally, the product could also be used as a cryogenic insulation for liquid natural gas fuel storage tanks or other kinds of cryogenic liquids.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLewis, M.J. “Sharp Leading Edge Hypersonic Vehicles in the Air and Beyond.” SAE International, SAE 1999 Transactions, 108, October 19, 1999, pp. 841-851. https://doi.org/10.4271/1999-01-5514  \r\n\tCedillos-Barraza, O.; Manara, D.; Boboridis, K.; Watkins, T.; Grasso, S.; Jayaseelan, D.D.; Konings, R.J.M.; Reece, M.J. and Lee, W.

The uncertainty surrounding these signals place fundamental limits on system performance and mission success. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks to upgrade or add non-acoustic sensing hardware to sonobuoys which will measurably improve DCL or tracking performance for active sonar (threshold 10% improvement over a sonobuoy without the capability, objective 25% improvement), particularly for scenarios where GPS is not available. An ideal solution will be low cost (adding less than $50.00 to the cost of a production sonobuoy), fit within the existing sonobuoy size (i.e., cylinder of diameter 4 7/8 inches, length 36 inches), weight (i.e., not cause a sonobuoy to exceed a maximum of 39 lbs) and power (SWaP) constraints (ideally a sensor requiring less than 12 volts and 25 milliamps), and be capable of improving several performance metrics. \r\n\r\nProposed solutions should identify the sonobuoy(s) to be upgraded, the performance metrics expected to benefit from the proposed sensor hardware improvements, and quantify the expected improvement through simulation and/or experiments. Sonobuoy improvements may consider adding transducers and/or replacing existing ones. Examples of such include, but are not limited to, buoy localization performance could potentially be improved by adding/replacing sensors to increase accuracy of time-of-flight and/or bearing measurements. Temperature and/or salinity sensors could be added to provide a partial sound speed profile for individual buoys. Sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMU), gyroscopes, and accelerometers could be used for motion compensation. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may be classified.

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Demonstrate feasibility of the proposed concept through analysis, simulation, and real-world measurements where possible. Analysis should include estimating the bounds of performance for the proposed method, and potential impacts to the existing sonar system operation. Conduct trade-offs of SWaP versus performance improvements for different sensing strategies. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine the concept and develop prototype sonobuoys with improved sensing. Evaluate the improvements using at sea experiments. Develop processing software for using the new sensors either aboard an aircraft or embedded in the sonobuoy. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Finalize and implement the capability into a sonobuoy that can be deployed in an open ocean environment during a data gathering event conducted by the Navy. Analyze the data collected in this real-world environment event and verify that the realized gains in performance matched the expected gains. \r\n\r\nThe technology developed under this effort has application across the Navy for sonar, radar, electro-optic, magnetic anomaly detection and other sensor devices. Any commercial application that uses sensors whose positions need to be known with more precision would benefit from this effort.

Acoustic signature detection is the traditional method in use today. For fixed-wing aircraft, those systems employ expendable sensors - sonobuoys - to enable detection of the submarine’s acoustic signals. The Navy would like to explore alternate, non-traditional concepts that overcome the detection limitation, in order to expand the tools available to operating forces and develop potentially more robust systems. \r\n\r\nThe principal fixed-wing ASW aircraft in operation today is the P-8 Poseidon. Any new approaches to airborne ASW will eventually require compatibility with that airframe. Also, the acoustic sensors used today are expendable devices. Testing will include hardware in-the-loop or laboratory modeling. Finally, any new approaches should not be considered a replacement for existing systems but as a supplement to expand airborne surveillance capabilities to detect those submarines, surfaced or submerged, with enhanced covert technology. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), formerly the Defense Security Service (DSS).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop and demonstrate feasibility of a non-traditional concept for an airborne ASW system that detects targets through exploitation of novel target/environment interactions. Consider the operating platform’s capabilities and limitations for guidance for the overall and ultimate system proposed. Provide sufficient detail to identify the concept (e.g., history, components, effects, hardware). The Phase I effort will also include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Identify critical technology areas requiring validating experimental data. Working with the Navy, define testable hypotheses and identify test equipment and geometries necessary to collect the critical data, which could also involve analysis of any existing data, building software/hardware fabrication, and potential laboratory experimental measurements. Demonstrate the prototype system and perform analysis as applicable. \r\n\r\nWork in Phase II may become classified.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Materials / Processes; Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a data-driven computational framework to enable prediction of material aging for designing a new/replacement composite component or its repair, assessing airworthiness of such a component during its lifetime and for assessing life extension.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: A building block approach is typically used in the design of composite material systems and their qualification and certification (Q&C). Knowledge gained by employing analytical models, along with tests at the coupon level, is employed in developing the next level design of structural elements. Similarly, the knowledge gained at the structural elements through computational models and testing enable the development of subcomponents and components [Ref 1]. \r\n\r\nComposite structures are typically designed to operate at much lower stress levels than their maximum strength and most of the loads are below fatigue threshold. However, history has shown widespread damage to occur towards the end of the designed life. This could very well be due to degradations in the metallic structures with which the composite parts interface in an aging aircraft. It could also be due to the accumulations of in-service overloads, such as flying over the rated G limits or impact loads caused by severe landings, both resulting in flaws that grow with further usage. These reveal the uncertainties and shortcomings of the current design and Q&C’s approach in meeting the damage tolerance design requirements, as included in the Joint Services Specification Guide, JSSG2006 [Ref 2]. \r\n\r\nA novel, computationally efficient framework is sought to accurately assess the structural integrity of individual airframe subjected to realistic flight usage and operating environments [Refs 3, 4, 5]. It should be capable of integrating various aircraft data ranging from flight state parameter history, available Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) sensors (e.g., strain gages, acoustic and/or fiber optic sensors) to airframe configuration, and maintenance and repairs [Refs 5, 6]. \r\n\r\nThe framework should account for, but not be limited to,: \r\n\r\n(a) realistic flight history data of flight conditions; \r\n\r\n(b) the gaps in the data; \r\n\r\n(c) mission specific loading and environmental variability; and, \r\n\r\n(d) identifying potential multiphysics trade-offs to enable accelerated testing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome of the composite material systems of Navy’s interest are glass fiber reinforced plastic and graphite-epoxy resin systems such as IM7/ 8552, AS4/3501-6, AS4/ IM977-3, and IM7/977-3.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Explore the feasibility of developing a framework for data-driven multiphysics algorithms for predicting the damage tolerance requirements of JSSG2006 for composites, as described above. Include the methodology for testing in-service loading and environmental conditions [Refs 9,10] for validation of the algorithms. Further, include the mechanism for filling gaps in the data for prediction of the airworthiness of composite components. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop the framework and demonstrate it for the platform chosen by the Navy by utilizing realistic flight history data for predicting damage tolerance of the component with specific issues identified by the Navy. Validate the multiphysics-based algorithms using appropriate tests simulating the in-service loading environment and for different blocks in the building block approach.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Apply the framework to the Navy selected platforms by integrating it with the data available from Structural Health Monitoring sensors, if any, and databases providing aircraft history of maintenance, repairs, and structural upgrades. Commercial passenger and cargo airlines could potentially benefit from this technology.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“MIL-HDBK-17-1F, Composite Materials Handbook: Vol. I.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Electronics; Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design, develop, and demonstrate an innovative digital firing device that will be used as a form, fit, and function interchangeable replacement for the airborne rocket launcher.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy is currently using an intervalometer, which fits inside launchers such as the LAU-68 or LAU-131. The device allows pilots to fire individual rocket tubes in sequential order or ripple-fire an entire launcher within seconds. With limited space, the current design seeks enhancement of power, while accounting for the controlling voltage losses due to ambient circuit resistance to ensure sufficient firing current. The only time power is applied to the circuit is when the pilot pulls the trigger. The desired design needs to use innovative circuit designs to overcome the lack of power needed to maintain the current firing state of the intervalometer when the trigger is released. The lack of power can be overcome by storing information during the power cycle or by other means such as, but not limited to, energy harvesting to provide supplemental power. \r\n\r\nThe Navy would like to steer away from the current analog device and move to something digital. The Navy is looking for a form, fit, and function innovative replacement that can be used interchangeably with the existing intervalometer and launchers, except that the functionality is expected to be achieved via a digital circuit board design (vice the current analog design). The device should be roughly the size of a small (roughly 8”L x 2”W x 2”H) handheld flashlight. The current device uses a rotating dial, but another means of allowing user input (LOAD/ARM, rocket selection) may be used such as, but not limited to, rotary encoders. \r\n\r\nGeneral operation of the intervalometer should provide rocket firing current outputs including, but not limited to,: \r\n\r\na) input power of 20.0 to 31.5 volts direct current (Vdc), otherwise, in accordance with the dc normal operation characteristics of MIL-STD-704 [Ref 1], is supplied through a 5.0 ohm ±10 percent resistor; \r\n\r\nb) control and apply rocket firing current to output pins sequentially; \r\n\r\nc) each rocket firing output pins should be tested using a 4 ohm ±10 percent resistor; \r\n\r\nd) rocket firing current pulse measured at each pin should be not less than 1.5 amperes (amps), with the load specified for not less than 10 milliseconds (ms). \r\n\r\ne) interruptions of this power, as a result of any type of contact bounce or switch chatter of 4.0 +/- 0.4 ms duration, should not interfere with the performance of the intervalometer; \r\n\r\nf) the single and ripple modes are controlled by an electrical switch located on the launcher structure; and \r\n\r\ng) interface with the single/ripple switch and identify firing mode prior to operation. \r\n\r\nThe operation of the digital firing device should be defined in two modes: single mode operation and ripple mode operation. In single mode operation, the intervalometer should apply rocket firing current to only one output pin in sequence with each application of power, and be capable of not less than 12 firings per second. In ripple mode operation the intervalometer ripple rate should be self-generating in such a manner as to apply rocket firing current to output pins in sequential order. The overall firing time in the ripple mode should fire rockets with a minimum delay of 5 ms and a maximum delay of 30 ms with at least a 10 ms dwell time and an output between firing pulses of a minimum 35 ms and a maximum of 45 ms. \r\n\r\nSetting the intervalometer to the LOAD position should internally ground all output circuits and prevent the intervalometer from being electrically sequenced upon the application of power. The internal grounding should be accomplished by means of the ground circuit. Upon completion of the last rocket firing, the intervalometer output should sequence to the LOAD position and not sequence any further (i.e., should not return to first rocket) upon the application of power. The arm circuit should provide the ground circuit to all outputs, but should also allow for electrical sequencing upon the application of power. The intervalometer should be manually switched from the LOAD position to the ARM position to provide positive arming of the intervalometer. \r\n\r\nThe intervalometer should provide a grounding circuit through the intervalometer to ensure safety during loading and preparation. The ground circuit should ground all output pins when the intervalometer is in the LOAD or ARM position. As the intervalometer is electrically advancing through its sequence, the ground circuit should ground each output pin except those being fired. The ground circuit should ground the output pin with a resistance of not greater than 0.1 ohm. If the intervalometer is manually advanced through firing positions to the LOAD or ARM position, all output pins should remain grounded. \r\n\r\nThe intervalometer should have a settable firing sequence to maintain launcher center of gravity during firing. In the event of a short circuit to ground or an open circuit on the output pins during rocket firing current application, the intervalometer should be fault tolerant and be capable of continuing operation without damage.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, develop, and determine feasibility of a proof of concept for the digital firing device. Ensure to account for tube slipping, handling, and manufacturing plans. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype digital firing device, and demonstrate its application in a test rocket launcher (provided as Government furnished equipment (GFE)). If available, demonstrate the capability on existing platform and/or platform representative examples.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Perform final development and testing to include conformance testing to applicable MIL-STDs [Refs 1, 2]. Support final system application testing onboard aircraft with full system test, in coordination with NAVAIR Test and Evaluation. \r\n\r\nThe intervalometer has a potential commercial use in the fireworks industry to sequence the launching of multiple fireworks with a determined time interval. In addition to this commercial use, these intervalometer can be sold to foreign militaries.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“MIL-STD-704F w/CHANGE 1: Department of Defense interface standard: aircraft electric power characteristics.” Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, December 5, 2016. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0700-0799/MIL-STD-704F_CHG-1_55461/  \r\n\t“MIL-STD-3018 w/CHANGE 2: Department of Defense standard practice parts management.

"topic_title": "High-Efficiency Midinfrared LEDs with High Brightness for High-Fidelity Infrared Scene Projection",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-021",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop midinfrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) with optical cavities electromagnetically engineered at a subwavelength scale to enhance wall-plug efficiency and brightness of devices beyond the current state-of-the-art technology and to demonstrate multipixel mid-infrared LED arrays.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the midinfrared spectral range, that includes both mid-wave infrared (MWIR) (3-5 micron) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) (8-12 micron) wavelength regions, are highly desired for the use in systems for infrared scene projection (IRSP), chemical sensing, and spectroscopy. Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing of infrared (IR) guided weapons necessitates infrared imagery to provide target signatures with high fidelity in a simulated environment with sufficient brightness. The capability to engage IR weapon and aircraft sensors and seekers with high-brightness, high-definition imagery of targets and backgrounds in HITL simulation is essential in the test and evaluation of the systems, such as threat detection and missile warning systems. Current IR scene projectors based on resistive emitter array technology have performance shortcomings such as low output radiance, slow frame rates, and small frame size. Compared to thermal sources, midinfrared LEDs can offer substantially higher radiance, modulation speeds, and significantly larger frame size over existing technologies. However, current devices are still highly inefficient. External wall-plug efficiency of state-of-the-art MWIR LEDs is currently below 0.5% at room temperature [Refs 1, 2] and that of LWIR LEDs is at least one order of magnitude lower [Ref 3]. \r\n\r\nLow wall-plug efficiency leads to low brightness of MWIR and LWIR LED systems. Low efficiency and brightness of midinfrared LEDs primarily result from a combination of low internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of light generation and low light extraction efficiency. IQE is limited by rapid non-radiative carrier recombination, which is dominated by strong Auger recombination at high pump currents [Ref 4]. As a result, IQE is estimated to be approximately 10% in the state-of-the-art MWIR LEDs operating around 3 microns [Ref 2] and drops quickly at longer wavelengths. For LWIR LEDs, IQE is well below 1% [Ref 4]. Furthermore, mid-infrared LEDs suffer from low extraction efficiency at 2% resulting from a narrow total internal reflection cone in LED materials [Ref 1, 2]. Parasitic voltage drops in the semiconductor heterostructure also have a negative effect on the midinfrared LED efficiency, although this factor has relatively minor effect compared to the two factors mentioned above [Refs 2, 3]. \r\n\r\nElectromagnetic engineering of LED optical cavities at a subwavelength scale can dramatically enhance light emission in the near- and far-infrared bands [Refs 5, 6, 7]. Subwavelength LED cavities can produce strong Purcell enhancement of spontaneous emission rates, which leads to drastic improvements in IQE, and enables optimal radiative emission rates of the photons in the cavity mode to free space, which improves output efficiency [Refs 5, 6, 7]. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to investigate if similar approaches may dramatically enhance midinfrared LED efficiency and to demonstrate high-performance midinfrared LED arrays based on this technology. Proposed approaches should design, fabricate, and characterize midinfrared LEDs with optical cavities electromagnetically engineered at a subwavelength scale to enhance wall-plug efficiency and brightness of devices beyond the current state of the art. The threshold and final objective wall-plug efficiencies of this MWIR LED arrays are 10% and 15%, respectively. Multipixel LED arrays based on this technology for high-fidelity, HITL testing should be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, develop, and demonstrate the feasibility of brightness and wall-plug efficiency enhancement of midinfrared LEDs using subwavelength optical cavity structuring to enhance spontaneous light emission rates into the LED material and out-coupling rates of light from the LED material to free space. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Fabricate and characterize a single element midinfrared LED prototype, with wall-plug efficiency at room temperature. Based on the new LED geometry, demonstrate feasibility of fabricating multipixel LED arrays. Fabricate and completely characterize the prototype with a 64x64 pixel addressable LED array. Prepare a report that summarizes the experimental evaluation and validation of performance characteristics of the developed system.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Fully develop and transition a 512x512 pixel addressable LED array-based dynamic IR scene projector per specifications based on the research and development of results developed during Phase II for DoD applications. \r\n\r\nThis type of high brightness, high-fidelity infrared scene projectors can be used as HITL testing of thermal imaging cameras used by firefighters.

Current generation devices with continuous wave (CW) output power over 3 Watts generally have a poor long-term reliability. Post-mortem analysis of failed high-power QCLs typically shows catastrophic output facet damage. The damage is strongly correlated with the peak optical intensity at the output facet. A game-changing solution is needed to enable the high-performance QCLs to have long-term reliability and meet/exceed the MILSPEC requirements [Ref 2]. \r\n\r\nAn effective, innovative approach to solving the laser optical damage problem is to reduce optical power density at the output laser facet. For a fixed output power level, this can be attained by judiciously increasing the output aperture size without affecting the diffraction-limited beam quality. This can be achieved by employing a second-order distributed feedback (DFB) configuration where optical output is collected from either the surface or the substrate side of the device, as opposed to the edge of the laser. In this case the output aperture is three orders of magnitude larger than that for edge-emitting QCLs, thereby improving the catastrophic optical damage threshold by more than 1,000 fold. An additional advantage of second order DFB QCLs is that they can be pre-screened on the wafer-level, leading to labor and material saving cost benefits associated with cleaving and testing substandard edge-emitting QCL devices. Also, packaging of surface-emitting devices on submounts is less demanding due to their increased alignment tolerance. Therefore, QCLs with large output aperture and reduced optical power density can provide a significant reduction in price per watt for high power CW QCLs. \r\n\r\nAlthough second order DFB QCLs were demonstrated over a decade ago, their performance significantly lags that for Fabry-Perot devices [Refs 3, 4]. In most explored DFB configurations, the grating interacts with the guided mode along the entire laser cavity. This unavoidably leads to additional optical losses, increasing laser threshold and reducing slope efficiency. This is especially detrimental to CW QCL operation. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks the development of a novel QCL configuration that effectively leverages improvements in CW power and efficiency achieved for state-of-the-art Fabry-Perot QCLs, while at the same time offering the unparalleled reliability advantage due to a significant increase in output aperture size. The final device configuration should be compatible with a large-throughput, low-cost production, and therefore should not involve epi-growth interruptions. The specifications of the CW QCLs should have a large output aperture size no smaller than 1 millimeter(mm) x 10 micrometers (µm), CW efficiency higher than 20% and output power level higher than 20 Watts delivered in a nearly diffraction-limited beam with M2 < 1.5.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, document, and demonstrate feasibility of high performance CW QCLs with a large output aperture size (no smaller than 1mm x 10µm). Demonstrate, using numerical modeling, that projected CW efficiency exceeds 20% and output power level exceeds 20W delivered in a nearly diffraction limited beam with M2 < 1.5. Ensure that the approach shows that projected fabrication cost for new devices does not exceed that for state-of-the-art commercial buried heterojunction QCLs. In the Phase I Option, if exercised, carry out proof-of-concept experiments. The approach should show that projected fabrication cost for new devices, does not exceed that for state-of-the-art commercial buried heterojunction QCLs. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Construct, develop, and demonstrate the prototype devices based on the design from Phase I. Test and continually improve QCL performance while demonstrating CW efficiency and power to meet topic requirements. Demonstrate that the QCL devices can operate at full power for over 10,000 hours.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Fully develop, fabricate, test, and transition the technology based on the design and demonstration results developed during Phase II for DoD applications in the areas of Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM), advanced chemicals sensors, and Laser Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). The commercial sector can benefit from this crucial, game-changing-technology development in the areas of detection of toxic gas environmental monitoring, noninvasive health monitoring and sensing, and industrial manufacturing processing.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBai, Y.; Bandyopadhyay, N.; Tsao, S.; Slivken, S. and Razeghi, M. “Room temperature quantum cascade lasers with 27% wall plug efficiency.” Applied Physics Letters, 98, 181102, May 2, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3586773  \r\n\t“MIL-STD-810H, Department of Defense test method standard: environmental engineering considerations and laboratory tests.” Department of Defense, January 31, 2019. http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-810H_55998/  \r\n\tBai, Y.; Tsao, S.; Bandyopadhayay, N.; Slivken, S.; Lu, Q.; Caffey, D.; Pushkarsky, M.; Day, T. and Razeghi, M. “High power, continuous wave, quantum cascade ring laser.” Applied Physics Letters, 99(26), 261104, December 28, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3672049  \r\n\tBoyle, C.; Sigler, C.; Kirch, J.; Lindberg, D.; Earles, T.; Botez, D. and Mawst, L. “High-power, surface-emitting quantum cascade laser operating in a symmetric grating mode.” Applied Physics Letters, 108(12), 121107, March 24, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4944846 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements; Machine Learning/AI\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human Systems\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a collaborative workspace to integrate the disparate locations where mission planning occurs, and to facilitate the mission planning process within the ready room while maintaining operational security.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: In order to greatly improve capability in mission planning, the Next-Generation Navy Mission Planning System (NGNMPS) is tasked to facilitate collaborative mission planning across ready rooms and planning cells both in close proximity and, when applicable, across ready rooms and planning cells that are distant from one another. Unfortunately, the current mission planning process utilizes a single laptop computer that will not suffice for the collaborative mission planning vision. With new technological tools such as tablets, smart boards, and digital touch screen tables, it is necessary to leverage these capabilities to improve the mission planning process. Technical approaches should identify potential solutions to achieve the integration and transfer of unclassified and classified (i.e., Secret) mission planning data. This effort will require a highly innovative approach to develop a solution that is sufficiently secure to meet National Security Agency (NSA) requirements for highly classified communications. Various levels of Emissions Control (EMCON) should be considered in the solution. Evaluations will be based on the ability for a solution to provide connectivity across various hardware (e.g., laptops, tablets, smart boards) from disparate shipboard locations (or even land-to-ship communications, if possible) while maintaining NSA requirements for secure communications in support of air operations mission planning. \r\n\r\nCurrent mission planning processes include calculating or planning data in one location, and then transmitting the information, whether by phone or by hand, to the mission planning lead where it is hand-entered into the current mission planning system. This relay of information can occur over and over again, leading to human errors in communication and increased opportunities for typographical error. The first goal of this project is to integrate the disparate locations where mission planning occurs. This solution will require an innovative solution to move data from the location where it is entered and transmit the data to all mission planning components while maintaining operational security. \r\n\r\nA secondary goal of this project is to facilitate the mission planning process within the ready room. The current use of obsolete technology for mission planning, mission briefing, and mission rehearsal are time-intensive, redundant, and prone to human error. Utilizing current state-of-the-art technologies for mission planning will greatly improve the mission planning process. . Some of the tools used require time-intensive processes like formatting slides, editing screenshots, and other redundant actions that could be eliminated with improved mission planning and briefing hardware. This second goal should leverage current state-of-the-art technologies including, but not limited to, tablets, smart boards, augmented or virtual reality (AR/VR) devices, and digital touch screen tables. Connectivity between these devices should consider security and space available on shipboard operations. Finally, working closely with the Strike Planning and Execution Systems Program Management Office (PMA-281), Naval Information Warfare Center – Pacific (NIWCPAC), and the NGNMPS development team, the performers on this project should understand and implement the software and user-experience considerations provided by NGNMPS program management. \r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, performers should consider innovative solutions including data fusion or other data consolidation techniques to reduce large amounts of spreadsheet data into smaller, more easily understood formats for briefing. Cognitive psychology, human perception, user interface, and human information processing should be considered when proposing a solution to this topic. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may be classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) formerly known as Defense Security Service (DSS). Since this project will ultimately integrated into the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), the selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVAIR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Assess briefing spaces, shipboard and otherwise, to identify the current state of the mission planning environment and mission planning processes. Consider communication with mission planners to determine which technological tools would be most utilized in a mission planning environment should also be considered. During Phase I Option, if exercised, perform user interviews that the Government will facilitate and support. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a hardware solution prototype to resolve security considerations and further develop the data reduction solution. Conduct continuous user evaluations facilitated and supported by the Government. Compile user feedback. Further refine the solution regularly. Perform software integration (React | Redux) and testing with NGNMPS. Continuous user evaluations and feedback will be conducted throughout Phase II. Government will facilitate and support user evaluations for performers. Final delivery should include a collaborative workspace that can provide efficient data management (i.e., multiple locations of data entry transmit to one central mission planning hub) and visualization for mission planning using the NGNMPS. Participate in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) process for NGNMPS throughout this phase. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate the software tool into NGNMPS. Conduct security validation and final user evaluations. \r\n\r\nThe ability to efficiently plan a mission is applicable to other efforts such as fighting wildfires or medical system coordination during a global pandemic. Multiple firefighting agencies must coordinate personnel, assets, and map data during crisis situations. For medical system coordination, similar information must be coordinated within and across hospitals, insurance agencies, and Government. Data visualization that facilitates quick information processing from users will facilitate decision making and quick deployment of solutions. This rapid information presentation and processing capability can improve decision making timeliness across sectors such as sports, medicine, and emergency response.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tForlines, C.; Wigdor, D.; Shen, C. and Balakrishnan, R. “Direct-touch vs. mouse input for tabletop displays.” Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 2007, pp. 647-656. https://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2007-053.pdf  \r\n\tHenderson, J.M. “Human gaze control during real-world scene perception.” Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(11), 2003, pp. 498-504. http://jhenderson.org/vclab/PDF_Pubs/Henderson_TICS_2003.pdf  \r\n\tRomero, D.; Bernus, P.; Noran, O.; Stahre, J. and Fast-Berglund, A. “The operator 4.0: human cyber-physical systems & adaptive automation towards human-automation symbiosis work systems.” IFIP international conference on advances in production management systems, September 016, pp. 677-686. https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01615707/document  \r\n\tNeisser, U. “Cognitive Psychology: Classic Edition.” Psychology Press, 2014. https://www.biblio.com/book/cognitive-psychology-psychology-press-routledge-classic/d/1332828530?  \r\n\tSeyed, T.; Burns, C.; Costa Sousa, M. and Maurer, F. “From small screens to big displays: understanding interaction in multi-display environments.” Proceedings of the companion publication of the 2013 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces Companion, March 2013, pp. 33-36. http://aseold.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/uploads/Publications/2013/p33-seyed.pdf \r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Munitions Lifting Assembly Sunshade Cover",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-024",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes; Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a strong, lightweight, lowest price, technically acceptable sunshade capable of blocking 70% of solar radiation and attain Naval Ordnance Safety and Security Activity (NOSSA) authorization for use with the A/E32K-11 Munitions Lifting Assembly (MLA).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The United States Marine Corps (USMC) requires the assembly of munitions in forward operational areas. The following descriptions are detailed in two parts: description of the fielded MLA system followed by the required performance of the Sunshade Cover. The solution desired through this effort is for the Sunshade Cover, but details of the MLA are necessary for developing the solution. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to satisfy the USMC requirements, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) procured the A/E32K-11 MLA; a replacement to the legacy A/E32K-3 Munitions Assembly Conveyor, and similar to the A/E32K-9 Munitions Assembly Conveyor II used by the United States Air Force [Ref 1]. The MLA provides a mobile capability for rapid assembly/disassembly of conventional munitions and a means to load/unload them from/onto munitions trailers. The system can be assembled/disassembled in a day, can be packed into three storage containers, and is C-130 transportable, making it capable of expeditionary missions. The system consists of roller conveyors, two A-frame gantries (each with a pneumatic hoist), four rail conveyors with associated munitions cradles, an Interface Control Board (ICB), and a lighting system. The rail conveyors each measure 10 ft (3 m) in length and are assembled end to end to create a 40 ft (12 m) munition assembly line. The two gantries are positioned at either end of the rail conveyor assembly for lifting bulk munitions from incoming pallets and removing assembled munitions from the rail conveyor to a munitions transport vehicle/trailer. The MLA also incorporates a grounding system comprised of a ground rod conforming to (CID) A-A-55804, Type III, Class B; and ground straps connecting the conveyors, gantries, ICB, etc. [Ref 3]. \r\n\r\nThe MLA requires a durable Sunshade Cover approved for use on the system by NOSSA – the technical authority pertaining to ordnance safety and the NAVSEA OP 5 Ammunition and Explosives Safety Ashore [Ref 5]. Design requirements include, but are not limited to, use of a static dissipative (surface resistivity between 10⁵ Ω/sq and <10⁹ Ω/sq) or conductive (surface resistivity <10⁵ Ω/sq)  material capable of discharging to ground. The static dissipative properties of the material used should not be met by use of topically applied treatment; that is, sprayed on the material. The material’s static dissipative properties must remain stable with long-term UV exposure and under varying humidity conditions. If the Sunshade Cover consists of multiple layers, the layers must be electrically integrated such that the surface resistivity measured with one probe on the outside of the material, and the second on the inside of the material, will yield the same results as if both were on the outside of the material. The Sunshade Cover design must not allow point-discharging and/or must bleed off any accumulated charges in a manner that will reduce the buildup of sufficient charge for electrostatic spark discharge (ESD).\r\n\r\nThe MLA Sunshade Cover must span the width of the two gantries, about 33 ft (10 m), and provide adequate protection from the sun to operators working in the rail conveyor area. The Sunshade Cover must not hinder the MLA system’s stability or operational capability, including the operator’s ability to assemble munitions without Sunshade Cover interference. The Sunshade Cover can, but is not required to, be attached to the MLA and must be capable of easy deployment/storage while the MLA structure remains standing about 16 ft in height (5 m). The Sunshade Cover should block at least 70% of solar radiation and be able to withstand the following environmental conditions:\r\n\r\n(a) low Temperature Operating Life (LTOL) with temperatures of -25 °F (-32 °C);\r\n\r\n(b) low temperature storage with temperatures of -65 °F (-54 °C);\r\n\r\n(c) high Temperature Operating Life (HTOP) with temperatures of 140 °F (60 °C) with a solar load;\r\n\r\n(d) high temperature storage with temperatures of 180 °F (82 °C);\r\n\r\n(e) 3% to 95% Relative Humidity (RH) (Ref 2);\r\n\r\n(f) rain, and/or blowing rain, falling at a rate of 2 in./h (5 cm/h) in winds of 40 mph (64 km/h);\r\n\r\n(g) blowing dust in concentrations of 0.3 g/ft³ +/­ 0.2 g/ft³ in winds of 35 mph (56 km/h); blowing sand in concentrations of 0.0623 g/ft³ +/­ 0.015 g/ft³ in winds of 35 mph (56 km/h);\r\n\r\n(h) ice, freezing rain, and/or water delivery with a rate of 25 mm/h with a droplet size of 1.0 mm–1.5 mm; and\r\n\r\n(i) salt fog for at least 96 hours [Ref 4].\r\n\r\nThe components comprising the MLA sunshade system should have a minimal footprint when not in use to enable storage in the MLA systems existing storage containers or a small standalone storage container. Material should be shown to resist fungus growth or deterioration. The Sunshade Cover must be field repairable to the greatest extent possible. Periodic maintenance and testing requirements must be minimal to none.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design for a sunshade cover. Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept in meeting the requirements through analysis and lab demonstrations. Provide one or multiple conceptual designs of an A/E32K-11 MLA Sunshade Cover. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design and develop a prototype sunshade cover for the A/E32K-11 MLA. Demonstrate use and wear over time to determine any degradation. Provide an estimate of per-unit cost with backup cost data, including parts/manufacturing. Provide a top-level failure analysis and service life estimate. Demonstrate the static dissipative or conductive nature of material using best industry practices. Facilitate and receive NOSSA approval for use of prototype with A/E32K-11 MLA system. Demonstrate that the use of the prototype does not negatively impact use of the A/E32K-11 MLA system. Provide a top-level assessment of whether the cover would pass requirements detailed in Reference 3, and when tested in accordance with the following information: (a) HTOL in 505.7 solar radiation with (procedure) I (cycling and heating effects) of 140 °F (60 °C) ambient air, (b) high temperature storage in 501.7 solar radiation with (procedure) I (storage) of 180 °F (82 °C) maximum; (c) LTOL in 502.7 solar radiation with (procedure) II (operational) in -25 °F (-32 °C) minimum; (d) low temperature (storage) in 502.7 solar radiation with (procedure) I (storage) in -65 °F (-54 °C) minimum; (e) rain in 506.6 solar radiation with (procedure) I (rain and blowing rain); (f) icing/freezing rain in 521.4 solar radiation with (procedure) I glazed ice of 13 mm thick; (g) humidity in 507.6 solar radiation; (h) sand and dust in 510.7 solar radiation with (procedure) I (blowing dust) and (procedure) II (blowing sand) in Air Velocity of 35 mph (56 km/h); and (i) salt fog for 96 Hours [Ref 4].\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the MLA sunshade for use on the A/E32K-11 MLA. Support United States Government testing and fielding of developed solution. The technology could be used for improved solar protection and material coverage in dusty/explosive environments (e.g., mining, refineries, oil rigs).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRowe, C. “MEOC and AAMOC students assemble munitions lifting assembly during WTI 2-18.

The Joint force is anticipating and entering an era where our tactical and operational communications dominance is in question and considers the peer/near-peer environment where the potential enemy can interrupt and impede our military operations. Looking to 2030, analysts and military professionals can no longer assume an unfettered technological advantage in the battlefield or established Joint Operational Area (JOA). Given these assumptions, the services have embarked on a variety of advance solutions needed to achieve success in the communications battlefield today’s, near-term, and future operating environments. The central theme to future improvements is a force that leverages several key concepts such as agile communications, single source networking, app services, and ultimately, a seamless Joint All Domain Command and Control Combat Cloud. \r\n\r\nCrucial in meeting the Joint forces demands of the future is gaining an understanding of the trade space; specifically, looking at the various products and concepts over the intervening years that are intended to help inform and guide service programmatic decision makers to the 2030 timeframe. Numerous developmental efforts such as agile communications, software defined radios, mobile Ad hoc networking, and emerging free space optical communications (FSOC) represent new innovation and in some cases center on refinements of existing capability. \r\n\r\nGiven the wide array of new innovation, an assessment process is needed in which to ascertain the trade space to overall risk, and with the ability to attain needed capabilities in which to engage and win in all warfighting domains. Typical individual communications research products tend to focus on a given set of metrics such as latency, jitter, link closures, bandwidth usage, and other detailed performance metrics. While detailed measure of performance (MOP) research and analysis is important, there is a significant gap presented to the decision maker, this gap centers on the ability to understand exactly what the trade space is with regard to attaining a desired operational mission F2T2EA (Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage and Assess) effect, or the ability of a system, or system-of-systems, to successfully execute mission effects chains. The operational mission analysis effects chain analysis would serve to further the overall development of emerging capabilities such as: \r\n\r\n(a) Manned-Unmanned Directional Mesh Enhanced Tactical Airborne Networks. This capability would support missions such as battlespace awareness, target development, intelligence preparation of battlefield, assault support approach and retirement lanes, landing zone evaluation, flank and rear area security, and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The application of the operational mission effects analysis would provide the ability to assess the effects of the Directional Mesh Enhanced Tactical Airborne Networks in quantifiable metrics which would include overall mission accomplishment assessments, risks and the ability to compress engagement–recovery timelines; and \r\n\r\n(b) Analysis of communications and networking solutions in support of Agile Communications architectures focusing on the secure cloud computing environment and impacts to warfare execution based on transactional information flow to and from permissive, contested, and anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) environments. \r\n\r\nIt is not enough to simply store raw data within the Tactical Combat Cloud-based infrastructure, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Apache Accumulo, because this does not provide a common data model that can be shared across a Multi-Domain Secure Lake architecture that meets the Data Sharing Authoritative Guidance for Enterprise Knowledge Base.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is a data management strategy and a work flow that recognizes the strengths of the focal plane gate arrays (FPGA)s at the edge with the task of providing specific data to the Tactical Combat Cloud. In turn, the Tactical Combat Cloud recognizes the role of the FPGA and graphics processor unit (GPU) at the edge in a Parent Child relationship. As a child of the cloud, a sensor will respond to tasking low level tasking in support of the overall data objective. The sensor will collect both the locally required (tactical) data as well as the data needed to complete the overall picture of the Tactical Combat Cloud object. The aggregate of sensors via a data normalization strategy will provide the machine to machine analytic to provide the human with a machine enabled decision. \r\n\r\nThe intent of conducting operation analysis is to provide quantitative data to the various proposed communications and networking solutions as presented. The results are focused on the operational effectiveness and benefit to the warfighter, to include tactical, operational and strategic level of warfare planning and execution. The analysis will aid in identifying: \r\n\r\n(a) the relevance and outcomes of proposed capabilities needed to enable modernization in the near-term and future timeframes when differing information sources, in both content and format are in use and differing information consumers across contexts to which information ought to be transmitted; \r\n\r\n(b) an operational assessment of communications and networking system shortfalls (gaps) such as missing, unreliable, and stale data; and multiple diverse input data/video streams use; \r\n\r\n(c) impacts of current, near-term, and future capabilities versus advancing threat capabilities; \r\n\r\n(d) a rapid and repeatable process that measures the operational impact of various proposed communications and networking solutions in geospatial and temporal relationships that are not permanent; \r\n\r\n(e) a probabilistic interpretation of the unlimited range of actual specific outputs of sensors and analytics to produce meaningful information management decisions and judgements; and \r\n\r\n(f) quality of Service (QoS) \r\n\r\n• Frequency of information updates: the rate at which updated values are sent or received. \r\n\r\n• Priority of data delivery: the priority used by the underlying transport to deliver the data. \r\n\r\n• Reliability of data delivery: whether missed deliveries will be retried. \r\n\r\n• Parameters for filtering by data receivers: to determine which data values are accepted and which are rejected. \r\n\r\n• Duration of data validity: the specification of an expiration time for data to avoid delivering “stale” data. • Depth of the ‘history’ included in updates: how many prior updates will be available at any time, e.g., ‘only the most recent update,’ ‘the last n updates,’ or ‘all prior updates’. \r\n\r\nAssumptions: \r\n\r\n(a) an IP-routable network is assumed to exist, and be self-managing and self-healing; \r\n\r\n(b) when and where one exists, the local Tactical Operations Center/Forward Operating Base (TOC/FOB) is assumed to be linked to the Global Information Grid/Joint Information Environment (GIG/JIE) with reliable, high-bandwidth connections. Further, it is assumed to have sufficient compute capacity to operate as a local Cloud, offering services to the tactical edge networks (TENs) linked to it; \r\n\r\n(c) operational units are hosting the tactical network within which that warfighter operates. It is further assumed that this tactical network may have attached sensors producing data that would typically be forwarded to the TOC/FOB for data enrichment. If, however, the tactical unit is temporarily disconnected from the TOC/FOB, then it is assumed that there is a local tactical processing gateway (TGW) serving the tactical unit that will offer backup services (appropriate for the compute platform available on the gateway), minimally, performing sensor data enrichment (such as tagging it with the current \"team\" and \"mission\") in support of VoI analysis (see below). Note, however, that the proposed architecture allows for a fully distributed gateway meaning that any participating node within the TEN could potentially “become” the TGW if required due to failure or destruction (albeit with potentially more constrained performance); and \r\n\r\n(d) processing power at the tactical node level (individual warfighter) will be extremely limited, due to Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) rations. Management of the tactical data flow will be managed by one or more TGW nodes at the unit level that can support the additional processing load, such as a vehicle, which connects the TEN to the TOC/FOB network.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an initial concept design to assess/grade various communications technology improvements against operational mission effect chains and outcomes to include requirements analysis and scenario development. Demonstrate that the proposed concept(s) is/are able to provide data distribution and information sharing within a battlespace, where each authorized user, platform, or node transparently contributes and received essential information and is able to utilize it across the full range of military operations among ad hoc and mesh networks. If the Phase I Option is exercised and if appropriate, include data ingress/egress and transformation/subscription services to validate processes, verify processes functionality, and assess processes readiness to conduct trade space analysis versus mission outcomes. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype based on the Phase I design; and demonstrate in a realistic data-to-decision mesh network tactical cloud environment. Propose, test and validate mitigations for any technical issues that are discovered during the testing and assessment. In the first Phase II Option, if exercised, augment in response to events/attacks with a proof-of-concept featuring automation of processes. In the second Phase II option, if exercised, fabricate the prototype using these automated processes and an aggregate of data consistent with these use cases, reflecting system operation over a sufficient period of time on which proposed learning processes can operate. The prototype system should be capable of running level 1 (data resolution) and level 2 (interference) fusion algorithms across geographically separate cloud nodes, each holding different data sources, some streaming; and be able to maintain data models and inferences about behavior while allowing machine learning from a distributed cloud architecture.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assess the prototype performance as part of a technology readiness level 6 or higher demonstration to support transition. Prototype should be capable of producing an application or set of applications that are capable of being generalized to N number of cloud nodes with relevance to Navy and Marine Corps use cases. The Phase III product(s) should be capable of running on program of record cloud systems such as DCGS-N using existing services to run against operational data. Realize the objective should be a concentration of operational relevance and transition. Propose commercial variants of the aerial layer network cloud philosophy. \r\n\r\nThe use of cloud architectures is becoming prevalent in both the DoD and private sector. Law enforcement and news services are private sectors that have a need to move beyond capabilities that enable data discovery in distributed clouds to systems that can implement complex data fusion algorithms. Data stored in clouds are already being used by these sectors to assess trends and discover events and activities of interest.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTu, X. “Management of dynamic airborne network using cloud computing [Conference Session].” 2012 IEEE/AIAA 31st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC), Williamsburg, VA, United States, October 14-18, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2012.6383025  \r\n\tLaw, E. “Cloud computing @ JPL science data systems.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Determine a form of boron or a boron-based chemical pathway that leads to implementation of boron in energetic compounds, especially fuels (solid and liquid).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Boron combustion tends to form species that are energetic dead-ends (the principal offender in this tendency is H-O-B-O). The use of a small amount of fluorine will tend to interrupt this result by breaking down the ceramic micro-encapsulation that molten boron exhibits. Current work to use boron in solid motors employs this technique, but the results depend on the application and test configuration. One potential reason for this is that this technique uses metallic (bulk) boron as a fuel, with the thermodynamic necessity of melting and evaporating the fuel prior to combustion. \r\n\r\nPrevious energetics work with boron indicated a necessity to incorporate the boron into potentially unstable compounds, the process of which increased the cost of the feedstock, and raised the likelihood of creating hazardous scenarios in the employment of the compound. Recent developments in the formation of boron allotropes have the potential to both lower feedstock cost and eliminate the need to use hazardous boron-bearing compounds. \r\n\r\nA possible alternate combustion pathway begins with another form of boron, either as a compound that yields boron during combustion of another fuel, or an allotrope of boron that features an oxidizing element already attached to it in the desired ratio. Ideally, the attachment of oxidizing species to a boron allotrope would also yield the desired properties that would allow the compound to be successfully employed in a solid motor grain or in a petrochemical liquid suspension or solution. \r\n\r\nThis topic seeks to survey boron compounds and combustion pathways that enable complete boron combustion (to B2O3 or other oxidized species) in both solid fuel and liquid fuel uses. Solutions can be considered in both solid and liquid forms. Compound characterization will be completed using: \r\n\r\na. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LCMS) to identify chemical species; \r\n\r\nb. Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS) to identify chemical species; \r\n\r\nc. Calorimetry to gauge the energetic potential; \r\n\r\nd. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to characterize atomic arrangement of fuel species; \r\n\r\ne. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR to characterize the evolved combustion species; \r\n\r\nf. Laser ablation of a solid casting to characterize the evolved combustion species; \r\n\r\ng. Combustors set to detect increased in thrust over neat-fuel combustion. \r\n\r\nTailoring the properties of the proposed materials will be undertaken after the determination of the material properties is made and an understanding of the needed property amendments can be described. When a suitable compound is achieved, the material will be tested in both solid and liquid forms. Laser ablation of a solid casting to characterize the evolved combustion species (captured as gases that are analyzed via GCMS) as well as calorimetry will provide the necessary data to evaluate the proposed use in a solid motor grain. Liquid combustion will be similarly sampled, using a calorimeter, a small-scale afterburner, and in a research-scale RDE. The combustors will provide the combustion gases to be analyzed by GCMS. Additionally, the combustors will be set to detect increases in thrust over neat-fuel combustion. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may be classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA), formerly the Defense Security Service (DSS). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVAIR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Survey boron compounds and combustion pathways that enable complete boron combustion (to B2O3 or other oxidized species) in both solid fuel and liquid fuel uses. Select the most promising compounds and pathways for further development in Phase II. Determine the technical feasibility of boron or a boron-based chemical pathway that leads to implementation of boron in energetic materials in a solid matrix (such as HTPB, or PBAN) for use in solid rocket motors, and in a hydrocarbon fuel (such as JP-10). Consideration of the materials for use in an afterburner or rotating detonation engine while also ensuring material characterization by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to ensure full understanding of the material composition. Additional material characterization should include calorimetry to discover the energetic potential of the material, liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LMCS) to characterize the compound properties in a liquid or suspended state, and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) to characterize the compound properties in a gaseous state (pre-combusted or combusted). These characterizations should result in understanding the boron-compound’s composition, structure, bond energies, energy-release potential, reaction pathways, combustion precursors, and combustion products. \r\n\r\nIf exercised, the Phase I Option will include tailoring the properties of the proposed materials so that they can be eventually tested in both solid and liquid forms. As new materials, there are no relevant MILSPECs pertaining to their performance testing; however, the materials will fall under the energetic materials testing SOP requirements at NAWCWD China Lake.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on Phase I work, continue to develop and validate selected material by modeling of the combustion of the materials to provide predictive results for small-scale testing to be scaled up for larger combustors/larger solid motor grains, while identifying and testing cost-reduction techniques for feedstock and compound production. Successful test results in full scale representative hardware will be documented, as appropriate, and will lead to Phase III. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A flying demonstrator will summarize progress to date and will collect data that will be of interest to mission requirements generators and technology stakeholders. An inexpensive flight platform will be selected for testing, a flight test will be executed, and the resulting data will be documented. Insertion of the technology into a Program of Record will be sought within PEO U&W. Production of the materials and techniques to obtain them will be pushed to full-scale, to allow economic production of the needed precursors, and finished fuels. \r\n\r\nThis technology has the potential to create commercial opportunity in supersonic and hypersonic transport, as well as for the space-launch industry.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLee, M.

For instance, polymer matrices embedded with carbon-based conductive materials have been demonstrated to attain excellent shielding performance. \r\n\r\nIt is the objective of this program to develop an ultra-lightweight EMI/EMP shielding material, based on the most state-of-the-art graphene composite, that will form a protective shield for naval avionics and other electronic systems against EMI/EMP threats. The graphene composite should be integrated with lightweight polymer to form conformal shield material that can conform to any shapes and sizes of packaging. The conformal composite should have shielding effectiveness of more than 70 dB across the wide frequency range from 500 MHz to 100 GHz for the completely shielded sensitive electronics/avionics. The electrical conductivity of the graphene composite should be higher than 3000S/cm. The weight of the graphene-based shielding composite should weigh no more than 10% of an aluminum shield with equivalent EM shielding performance.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a shielding material composite and fabrication method that meets shielding protection requirements. Use the proposed fabrication method to fabricate a sample of no smaller than 6 x 6 inches in size with appropriate thickness that will meet the shielding protection requirements. Demonstrate the feasibility of the material design via experimentally characterizing the electromagnetic performance of the sample relative to the metal analog in terms of shielding effectiveness over the frequency range from 500 MHz to 100 GHz, in accordance with the MIL-STD requirements [Refs 5, 6, 7, 8]. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate and validate a three-dimensional (3-D) enclosure prototype for EMI/EMP shielding protection for naval avionics and electronics.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Battlespace Environments; Electronics\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Demonstrate printed-microstrip antenna size reduction through substrate permeability for improved size, weight, and power (SWaP), bandwidth performance, phased array architecture, improved low observability and probability of detection characteristics.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The limits of microstrip antenna miniaturization are reached as permittivity values approach low double digits; at which point the antenna becomes too inefficient a radiator for practical use in an airborne communication system. Appreciable reductions in microstrip antenna size can be gained through an increase in the permeability of the printed antenna’s substrate [Refs 1, 3, 5, 6]. When compared to traditional permittivity (only) increases, a combination of standard permittivity increases with novel permeability increases could result in comparable size reduction and better Radio Frequency (RF) performance [Refs 1, 3, 6]. The permittivity of printed antenna substrates is often increased to decrease antenna size, sacrificing antenna efficiency resulting in poorer RF performance and heat generation [Refs 2, 4, 6]. Permeability can also be increased to reduce size while counterbalancing the effect of permittivity increases on the antenna’s characteristic impedance, resulting in a better performing, more efficient, miniaturized antenna that operates over a wider bandwidth [Refs 1, 3, 6]. Smaller conformal printed antennas can be integrated while minimizing impact to the aerodynamic characteristics of the hosting aircraft. Smaller antennas that have undergone a 50% reduction in size due to magnetic properties are sought. In addition, miniaturized conformal antennas can be integrated while minimizing negative impacts to the Radar Cross Section of an aircraft, when compared to common antennas. Aircraft with smaller conformal antennas operating from the Aircraft Carrier (Nuclear Propulsion) (CVN) could potentially have better Low Observable/Low Probability of Detection (LO/LPD) profiles than their standard counterparts, decreasing the likelihood of CVN detection.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an initial conceptual design for a conformal microstrip patch antenna that has been reduced in size by 50% solely as a result of the substrate material&#39;s electromagnetic permeability characteristics while minimizing loss so that loss is comparable with practical printed antennas miniaturized through other means. Perform modeling and simulation in order to provide a conceptual design trade study for the antenna and its substrate. The Phase I Option period, if exercised, must include developing an initial antenna design that includes a plan for substrate fabrication, antenna feed design, and anticipated prototype antenna fabrication cost. Any microstrip antenna shape can be considered, as well as any permittivity characteristic for the substrate as long as a 50% reduction in size due to magnetic properties can be demonstrated. The design must also demonstrate improved antenna efficiency and frequency bandwidth for the prototype antenna over traditional antennas of equivalent size that have been miniaturized solely through increased permittivity. The Phase I effort must design, develop, and deliver a model of the antenna radiation pattern, impedance, efficiency, and explanation of antenna miniaturization attributes. The Phase I effort must include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype based on the Phase I design. Test antenna prototype to validate maturity and expected/modeled performance.

"topic_number": "N211-029",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Recovery and Handling of Group 3 through Group 5 fixed wing UAVs from ships other than an aircraft carrier to significantly increase lethality, project force, and increase the coverage of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The USAF’s XQ-58A Valkyrie drone aircraft is the primary fixed wing Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) planned for integration into Navy ships smaller than aircraft carriers. This SBIR topic complements a previous NAVAIR topic N202-109 entitled “Launch System for Group 3-5 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Land-and Sea-Based Operations.” In order to reduce costs, the XQ-58A was not designed to be outfitted with landing gear. The Air Force instead uses rocket assist to launch the drone and deploys an on board parachute for recovery. The Navy under this topic is seeking an innovative approach that does not mandate the use of a parachute in order to recover the XQ-58A. Additionally, this topic needs to address the recovery of group 3 through 5 UAVSs that are outfitted with their own landing gear and equipped with a tail hook. \r\n\r\nOperation of Group 3 through Group 5 (Group 3-5) fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from ships other than aircraft carriers with a UAV Capture and Handling System must be capable of decelerating a fixed wing jet-powered UAV, with a wingspan of 30 feet and weight up to 6000 pounds, down from speeds up to 160 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS). The placement of system components must reside, to the maximum extent possible, within the hull of the Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) class of ships. Coordination with both Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) will be critical to understanding the available space(s) aboard ship for system placement to minimize mission impact of other functions of the ship, as well as any weight and power restrictions. \r\n\r\nThe Recovery and Handling System must be designed to not interfere with normal topside flight deck operations of the ESB and accommodate Group 3-5 UAVs with or without landing gear including the Air Force XQ-58A Valkyrie. It must also be reconfigurable such that it can be transported to conduct both ground-based operations and shipboard operations aboard an ESB. Should features of the system exceed available onboard space, a stowable sponson assembly can be envisioned to extend from either side of the ESB, serving as the UAV “runway” and interfacing directly with the capture and handling technology. The sponson may extend as far as 79 feet from the ESB and is limited to a length of 300 feet. Any design solution relying on a sponson must address impact on the ship’s performance, both pier-side and at sea, and may not interfere with basic ship or flight deck operations. Ship attitude during UAV recovery should be at a fixed bearing to optimize wind conditions and ship speed up to 15 knots as required. \r\n\r\nThe UAV Recovery and Handling System must be simple enough in design to allow for sustained operations at high sortie generation rates with a goal of a UAV capture every two minutes. The system must demonstrate high reliability with minimal maintenance down time for 24 hour/7 day surge periods. It is desired that routine maintenance should be accomplished in stride with operations. Details of the Recovery and Handling System need to include all the necessary subsystems and interface components required for installation aboard the ESB. The system must also adhere to all applicable environmental standards of the latest version of MIL-STD-810 such as shock, vibration, electromagnetic interference/emission, etc.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept design to meet the objectives in the Description. Through modeling and simulation, demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and establish that the concept can be developed into a useful product for the Navy. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver a prototype. Demonstrate a 1/8 scale prototype of the Launch System using a 100-pound UAV provided by the Government, conduct a ground demonstration of the prototype Recovery and Handling System. If the land-based testing is determined to be successful, a full-scale design suitable for at-sea testing will be developed during the options of the Phase II effort. This prototype development will involve multiple ship check visits to an ESB Class ship on either the east or west coast of the United States. One full-scale prototype will be constructed for both the land-based and at-sea testing. After successful full-scale land based testing, at-sea testing will follow in further development.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The technology being developed in this proposed NAVSEA SBIR topic as well as NAVAIR SBIR N202-109 are being planned for installation aboard a ESB to enable operation of fixed wing UAVs with or without landing gear ranging in size from Group 3 through 5. In addition to being able to operate these fixed wing UAVs from ships the Marine Corps have expressed interest in having this same technology packaged in kit form, so it could be transported via ground vehicles in the field to remote areas including islands and readily assembled by troops operating in the field to enhance air domination as the USMC seek to engage our enemies in their own backyard. This type of technology could be useful for commercial UAV delivery systems in cities. \r\n\r\nThe growing industry of aerial consumer package delivery could be profoundly impacted by advances in UAV capabilities.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tShugart T.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a Kilowatt (kW) class Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulse laser hardened optical system for submarines.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Submarines may be subject to high power laser beams, which may damage optics and sensors in beam directors and periscopes. The Navy is seeking a technology that would allow laser hardening of vulnerable optical components in beam directors, periscopes, or other optical system without compromising their functional capabilities such as imaging, and directing a high-energy laser beam with no losses or wave front distortion. The radiation hardening system will integrate into submarine optical systems to include at minimum beam directors, periscopes, and imaging systems. Commercial optics employ thin films whose primary purpose is not the scope of this SBIR topic. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is seeking a design to be developed employing technology based on 4th generation transparent materials. In general, the current thin film based technology, thin enough not to generate substantial heating within the film when exposed to the high-power laser beams, while still having high optically nonlinear response to the influence of high power CW (continuous wave) or pulsed laser beams of relevant wavelengths will be considered. Due to 100’s kW class CW laser power at 1 or 1.5 µm laser wavelength and picosecond laser pulse of greater than 10 mJ per pulse, the material response shall not be accompanied with increased absorption as for example two-photon absorption per pulsed beams. The blocking of the high-power beams shall rather be a result of beam deflection away from the vulnerable optics into, for example, a radiation dump. Such photo-triggered diffraction gratings should diffract over 99% of radiation and have an aperture up to 12” in size. The proposed materials damage threshold shall be greater than 100’s MW for CW and greater than gigawatts for pulse lasers at 1 and 1.5 µm wavelength. Prototypes will be tested at a Navy lab in order to test, evaluate, and validate the specifications identified above. \r\n\r\nPassive approaches will be considered, provided they are capable of rejecting high-power beams with an efficiency of rejecting greater than 80% of the optical power with only 20 degrees C of additional increase in the substrate temperature. Thin film photonic bandgaps, passive or photo-responsive seem particularly promising for this purpose. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Provide a concept to solve the Navy’s problem based on the requirements in the Description, and demonstrate the feasibility of that concept. Develop a concept for laser hardening and perform a trade study for submarine applications. Demonstrate feasibility through modeling and simulation. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype system for HEL kW class direct high energy laser testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). Develop the required technology into a prototype device and demonstrate that it meets the requirements in the Description. Test and refine the prototype into a technology that the Navy can use. Deliver the prototype laser hardened optical system, around 12 inch in diameter for kW class test and evaluation by U.S. NAVY. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support transitioning the technology for Navy use. Identify the final prototype product for transition into NAVSEA undersea platform and plan for the transition to Phase III, to include validation, testing, and HEL testing for Navy use. This technology has potential commercial transition to other applications such as industrial material processing window (welding, cutting, soldering, marking, cleaning, etc.) and fundamental research window.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tS.R.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an advanced detection and targeting control for High Energy Laser (HEL) operating in the complex marine environments where the proposed RAMAN metrological sensor will also improve the submarine imaging and Radio Frequency (RF) detection.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy seeks technologies that are oriented toward a deeper experimental and theoretical understanding of maritime turbulence and laser light propagation in the marine boundary. Ocean evaporation is occurring within a very thin molecular layer at the surface. However, there are indications that turbulent structures in the ocean and atmospheric mixing layers play a critical role in determining the water vapor flux. The current measurement techniques, such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), are limited to resolutions of 1 micro meter or greater and fall short of the required sub micrometer level resolution. A new type of spectral imaging modality and instrumentation is required that will increase our understanding of ocean evaporation and lead to better tools for measuring and modeling the near-marine boundary layer for optical and radio frequency Naval applications. This generalized understanding will significantly enhance beam optic directors, adaptive optics, and other turbulence mitigating techniques to enhance the reach and effectiveness of communication as well as defensive and offensive laser light engagement in the marine boundary layer. \r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of this STTR topic are to: 1) develop a system capable of measuring atmospheric turbulence near the ocean surface (0 to 60 feet); 2) develop models that can predict turbulent effects given a set of atmospheric and marine surface conditions, such as surface temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wave, fog, etc., that can affect marine wave boundary layer atmosphere; and 3) develop a metrological instrument based on RAMAN light detection and ranging (LIDAR). A RAMAN metrology system should be capable of accepting RAMAN signals from lasers operating in three octaves from the Near-Infrared (NIR) (~1 um), Visible (~500nm), to the Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) (~250nm). The multi-band RAMAN metrology system’s simultaneous backscattering analysis of three wavelength intensity measurement ratio would be able to validate atmospheric Rayleigh and Mie scattering models. The system would be used to adapt existing atmospheric models or creating new physics-based models of the marine boundary layer. The RAMAN spectrometer must be able to collect data at a repetition rate of at least 1 kHz in all three wavelength ranges. The metrology system technology should be compatible with a marine operating environment in accordance with MIL-STD-810H and capable of integration into a submarine sail or mast. This form factor capable of fitting within a 12 inch cubed volume would facilitate widespread deployment as a metrological tool for marine wave boundary atmospheric characterization. The RAMAN metrology system (multiband source, detector and software for analysis) is also the part of High Energy Laser (HEL) closed loop circuit to control the HEL beam on target. The proposed 3-band picosecond RAMAN laser shall be able to integrate into HEL systems for target ranging and detection. In this configuration, the system has the potential to enhance substantially Navy capabilities for deployed high power lasers operating in the marine environment. In this effort the proposer should use Open Model Based Engineering (MBEE) for the development of software, hardware and documents. \r\n\r\nTesting and evaluation will occur at a Navy laboratory and will measure the effectiveness of the RAMAN metrology system to accept three synchronized laser pulses in the ultra violet (UV), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) spectral bands. The laser pulse will have a temporal pulse width between 5 ps and 1 ns and a pulse repetition rate between 1 kHz and 5 kHz, and a stable, narrow laser bandwidth of a few wavenumbers or less sufficient to distinguish RAMAN lines. The RAMAN metrology system (multiband source and detector) should have a resolution of a few wavenumbers in each spectral region. The company shall acquire mJ per pico second multiband source for the compact RAMAN System development. The Government may also furnish a 3-band mJ per band pico source as a second source to the company for integration and comparison studies into compact RAMAN System. Both software and hardware of the integrated RAMAN system (source and detector) are to be delivered to Navy.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a RAMAN metrology system based on Model Based Engineering (MBE) as outlined in the Description. Demonstrate the feasibility of that concept through architecture modeling, simulation, and theoretical calculation. Ensure that the RAMAN metrology system is capable of producing the required spectral resolution in each of the wavelength bands at the predicted repetition rate. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a RAMAN metrology prototype solution based on MBE.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype of a 3-band RAMAN metrology system based on the concept developed in Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). Integrate the RAMAN metrology system with the 3-band laser source, detector and software for analysis. Work with the Navy for the evaluation of performance and further characterization for the purpose of RAMAN back scattering to characterize atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity. Support the Navy for validation and additional testing to be qualified and certified for Navy use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy submarine platforms as a metrological tool for marine wave boundary data collection. This technology can improve a commercial ship’s localized weather prediction and update the weather software for safe operation. Additionally, improved LIDAR detection for range at day, night, and all-weather conditions is beneficial for both commercial and DoD applications. The RAMAN metrology system could also find applications in trace gas and pollution monitoring.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWasiczko Thomas, Linda M., Moore, Christopher I.; Burris, Harris R.; Suite, Michele; Smith Jr., Walter Reed and Rabinovich, William. “NRL&#39;s Research at the Lasercomm Test Facility: Characterization of the Maritime Atmosphere and Initial Results in Analog AM Lasercomm.” Proc.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-032",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a modular Launch and Recovery system for On-Board Handling and Servicing of Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) that can be used on amphibious platforms.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Current Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) recovery systems are designed for the LCS Classes or Shore based operations, and not easily transferrable to other Ship Classes. The Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) with a length of 85 feet, weight of 180,000 pounds and height and width of 8.5 feet would provide a physical challenge to deploy from any Navy ship. These systems are specially designed to capture an Unmanned Vehicle (up to the Large Diameter size) and bring it onboard an LCS using the Twin Boom Extensible Crane (TBEC) on the Independence Class or Launch Recovery Handling System (LRHS) on the Freedom Class. The TBEC and LRHS are specialized systems with unique design features that are not found on other platforms throughout the fleet. Since the original design for the launch & recovery systems were tailored to the LCS variants, they do not integrate easily on other Ship Classes where conventional launch and recovery procedures are used. Current launch and recovery requirements drive the Navy to develop unique solutions that are not cross compatible with other USVs, UUVs, and XLUUVs. The technology to be developed in this effort will provide NAVSEA with a common launch and recovery capability deployed on LCS, L-class, and Shore-based platforms to launch and recover vehicles in the NAVSEA UxV portfolio. The developed launch and recovery system must not require structural modifications to the ship, must operate in Sea State 3 and the design should not impede stern gate actuation, ballasting, or other critical ship operations. A preferred system would be modular, adaptable and scalable to support smaller future unmanned systems. \r\n\r\nThe LPD 17 Class ships mission is to transport troops and equipment for amphibious operations and land them in the assault area by means of embarked Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), conventional landing craft, or Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV). Each LPD 17 Class ship encompasses more than 22,000 square feet of vehicle storage space and 28,000 cubic feet of cargo storage. Vehicle storage space is provided through a well deck design. The LPD 17 Class well deck is 188 feet long and approximately 50 feet wide at mid well, increasing to 59 feet at the sill, or stern of the ship. Clearance above the well deck is 31 feet. The ship is able to ballast down to flood the well deck with 9 feet of seawater at the sill and 4.5 feet at the forward portion of the well during wet well operations and landing craft maneuvers.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a modular Launch and Recovery system for On-Board Handling and Servicing of the current Navy XLUUV that can be used on an LPD 17 class of ship. The Navy will provide dimension and movement specifications for both the unmanned system, and the ship locations in which the modular Launch and Recovery system for On-Board Handling and Servicing would reside. Companies will demonstrate feasibility of their designs through modelling and draft concepts of operation. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver a prototype modular Launch and Recovery system for On-Board Handling and Servicing of the Navy XLUUV on the LPD 17 class of ship. This prototype development will involve multiple ship check visits to a LPD 17 Class ship on either the east or west coast of the United States. The prototype will first be evaluated on land at both the company’s facility and the location where the XLUUV is stored to determine the system’s capability in meeting the performance goals defined in Phase II SOW. If the land-based testing is determined to be successful, at-sea testing will be accomplished at the end of the Phase II effort with the XLUUV and the company’s prototype modular Launch and Recovery system for On-Board Handling and Servicing. The at-sea testing will involve the company’s system demonstrating movement of the XLUUV from a stowage location on the vehicle deck to the well deck, and then launching and recovering the XLUUV. One overall prototype can be used for both the land-based and at-sea testing. Validation and qualification of the final company product will be achieved during Phase II. The company will prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Upon successful completion of Phase II, the company will be expected to support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The company will refine the design of the final modular launch and recovery system that can be used for the XLUUV, but also adapted to other Navy unmanned systems. The company will support the Navy for test and validation in accordance with Navy regulations and requirements. Following testing and validation the end design is expected to first be deployed on the LPD 17 Class, and capable of being utilized across all Navy amphibious platforms with well decks. This technology will help the Navy meet critical needs of increased warfighting capability for L-Class ships and expand the Amphibious Warfare Mission Area(s).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tO’Rourke, Ronald. “Navy Large Unmanned Surface and Undersea Vehicles: Background and Issues for Congress.” Congressional Research Service.

Current methodologies in the submarine fleet, for example, employ periodic, hand-held, wired machinery vibration measurements to provide predictions of machinery failure. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is thus seeking a broad range of emerging technologies that take advantage of commercial advances in sensor development, Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics as applied to machinery data to develop digital twins that allow for Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) of assets. Monitoring the current and expected future states of these systems will allow the Navy to more effectively maintain their platforms through an increased awareness of system health. Furthermore, maintenance planning is better served by an increased awareness of remaining useful life of components. By analyzing the optimal mix of resilient design and onboard/forward deployed spares, this solution supports On Time Delivery by maintaining the right parts where they are most needed to support the mission, ultimately reducing life cycle costs of the program sustainment activities. \r\n\r\nOf specific interest, the Navy is interested in the use of wireless sensing technologies that can simultaneously collect and transit machinery vibration (0 – 6000 Hz) and power data (current and voltage TBD) that are in conformance with naval platform operational restrictions. Although this technology has been demonstrated in academia, there is no commercial application of such technology aboard current Navy platforms. \r\n\r\nUse of wireless sensing technologies will provide an easier means of collecting and storing data from a broader range of sensors when compared to similar wired solutions. The small business should develop a combination of software (sensor proprietary if necessary; COTS telemetry infrastructure) and hardware that would allow for collection of data from shipboard machinery and wirelessly transmit this data to an onboard storage or display device. \r\n\r\nThe solution should allow for a minimum of two simultaneous sensing modalities – mechanical vibration and machinery power attributes – to support monitoring of machinery health. Additional sensing modalities could include temperature, pressure, or acoustics depending on the type of machinery monitored. The developed sensor should be able to obtain power at its installed location source and should not require cabling to a remote power source. Solutions that do not require human intervention, i.e., replacement of batteries, are preferred but not required. The solution could, but is not required to, be applicable to either manned or unmanned platform. However, the solution will be required to communicate data securely from the sensor to the storage medium on board the submarine. \r\n\r\nWhile the solution provided by the company will be used to support the development of digital twins for Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), CBM solutions are not required to be provided as a deliverable. Rather the vendor should focus on developing a modular infrastructure that allows for secure communication between the sensor and storage location. These communication protocols will be platform dependent but include considerations such as physical access controls, power management and environmental controls and strategic/local command security protocol procedures. Size, weight and power should be constrained to not interfere with machinery operation and to operate autonomously in excess of two weeks without maintenance (e.g., battery replacement). \r\n\r\nThe Phase II effort is anticipated to include testing by the small business in an operationally relevant environment with final testing by the Navy (Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division) in a laboratory or at-sea environment as appropriate. The product will be validated, tested, qualified, and certified for Navy use across a wide range of conditions (e.g., machine operating parameters, ship depth, sea water temperature, etc.) as applicable for the relevant class of problem. \r\n\r\nDepending on the scope of the proposal, the Phase II effort may require secure access, and NAVSEA will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access. The Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. If need be, data of the same level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I or Phase II work. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept to solve the Navy’s problem and then demonstrate the feasibility of that concept. The expected product will be a combination of hardware and software. Feasibility should be demonstrated by a laboratory bench test or a limited scale field experiment. As an example, a vendor might propose a demonstration of one modality of data being collected on a representative asset in the lab and transmitted securely to a storage device and/or display. The vendor is expected to propose concept feasibility testing as part of their proposals. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype system for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I work and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). The prototype system will vary based on the awardee’s proposed approach, but it may include hardware and software. The test and evaluation hardware may be a commercial system (e.g., a commercially available vent fan), a Navy-provided system (e.g., a main seawater pump), or a combination of commercial and Navy-provided systems (e.g., an integrated life support system). The prototype will be evaluated in a Navy lab or at-sea environment. The Navy may opt to choose a surrogate platform for at-sea testing based on availability of assets. Additional laboratory testing, modeling, or analytical methods may also be appropriate depending on the company’s proposed approach. In general, two prototype articles should be provided to the Government for testing, at least three months prior to the end of Phase II. A Phase III development plan will be required at the end of Phase II. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort and any follow-on efforts could be classified (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The final product will be software integrated with Navy-provided hardware, or software integrated with company-provided hardware. The Navy expects the vendor to support transition to Phase III through system integration, testing support, software and hardware documentation, and limited hardware production if applicable. Possible platforms where the technology will be used include current and future submarine platforms. The technology must meet critical Navy requirements in terms of secure communications between the source and the storage medium onboard the platform. These may be related to WLAN security (encryption, authentication), Electromagnetic Interference (EM), radiological and hazardous material constraints, limits on total radiated power and other relevant requirements in effect at such time. In Phase III, the product will be validated, tested, qualified, and certified for Navy use in at-sea trials across a wide range of conditions as applicable for the relevant class of problem. Additional software testing will likely also be required to ensure that all applicable conditions can be tested even if they do not occur during at-sea test periods. \r\n\r\nThese solutions have potential for use on other undersea platforms such as Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) as well as a wide range of surface platforms.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGreen, D.; Lindahl, P.; Leeb, S.; Kane, T.; Kidwell, S., Donnal, J., “Dashboard: Nonintrusive Electromechanical Fault Detection and Diagnostics.” Proc.

"topic_title": "Submarine Atmospheric Contaminant Scrubbing Technology",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-034",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To provide passive atmospheric contaminant scrubbing technologies to reduce and/or eliminate gas contaminants from 1 to 6 atmospheres absolute (ata).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: When a DISabled SUBmarine (DISSUB) event occurs, several dangerous and potentially lethal atmospheric contaminants can be introduced from fire, battery malfunctions, and other potential sources. These contaminants, if not appropriately managed or removed, can limit the time DISSUB survivors can await rescue. At this time, the submarine force has limited means of removing dangerous atmospheric contaminants, beyond Carbon Dioxide (CO2), from the DISSUB atmosphere when the internal compartment is either pressurized or there is insufficient available power to utilize other scrubbing technologies. Currently there is no known commercially available technology to passively scrub these contaminants. \r\n\r\nThe concept of operations (CONOPS) for a DISSUB rescue begin with a senior onboard survivor measuring and monitoring specific atmospheric containments via the USN DISSUB Guard Books. These guard books provide the procedures necessary to support DISSUB survivors in awaiting rescue by rescue forces for a minimum of seven days after the DISSUB event. Additionally, the Guard Books enable the survivors to determine when the atmosphere has been contaminated to a point that it is no longer safe to wait for rescue and therefore escape is required. While awaiting rescue is the preferred method for survivors, the inability to lower or eliminate specific hazardous contaminants may require survivors to attempt escape. Oxygen (O2) is added to and CO2 is removed from the internal compartment atmosphere passively via Chlorite candles and Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) scrubber curtains, respectively. However, there are an additional seven constituents that have been identified by medical personnel as being dangerous to DISSUB survivors when subjected to prolonged exposure to elevated levels. These constituents are defined as the Submarine Escape Action Limit (SEAL) gases and are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN), Ammonia (NH3), Chlorine (Cl2), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). \r\n\r\nThe program office desires the development of a technology that can provide the ability to passively lower and/or eliminate the 7 SEAL gases identified from a DISSUB internal compartment. In the event of a DISSUB, it is anticipated that the submarine will not have sufficient available power to support an active system. Additionally, the use of a passive system will reduce the production of Carbon Dioxide that would result from survivors using a manually operated system. Due to onboard constraints, the solution(s) should minimize the footprint of the equipment and maintenance requirements. Additionally, to reduce survivor physical stressors and CO2 generation, the solutions(s) should minimize human system operations while also remaining cognizant of the limited power that may be available. Note that stand-alone battery power for the equipment is acceptable, but the use of Lithium Ion (LIO) batteries is not. Due to internal compartment space constraints, the proposed solution should minimize, as much as practical, the footprint of any required installed equipment as well as maintenance and lifecycle cost requirements. \r\n\r\nIn terms of technology development efforts, the threshold is the ability to reduce contaminant levels below SEAL 2 levels as quickly as possible and maintain the contaminant levels below SEAL 2 levels for a minimum of seven days. The SEAL 2 levels are CO 150ppm, HCN 15 ppm, NH3 125 ppm, Cl2 2.5ppm, HCl 35 ppm, SO2 30 ppm, and NO2 10 ppm. The objective is the ability to reduce and maintain contaminant levels at or below SEAL 1 levels for a minimum of seven days (CO 125ppm; HCN 10 ppm; NH3 75 ppm; Cl2 1 ppm; HC1 20 ppm; SO2 20 ppm; CO2 5 ppm). Testing will be conducted via bench-test in a simulated environment comparable to the anticipated operational environment at NSWC Philadelphia. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being a safety and duty of care issue, continued advancement and modernization of the USN Submarine Escape and Rescue Program is considered an Assistant Secretary of the Navy core field in support of the larger Undersea Warfare, and directly aligns to both the National Defense Strategy and the Submarine Commander&#39;s Intent by defending the homeland; enabling interagency counterparts to advance U.S. influence and national security interests; ensuring USN submarine warfighting readiness and survivability; and strengthening alliances and attracting new partners. The latter was highlighted in the geopolitical outcome following the USN Submarine Escape and Rescue response to the ARA SAN JUAN incident in November 2017.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a conceptual solution that defines the methods and identify the major components required to meet the requirements in the description. Feasibility will be determined by identifying the catalyst required and scientific calculations and modeling to support required contaminant reduction catalyst technologies. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include refinement of the proposed solution to support Phase II prototype development and the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of the Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), refine, as necessary, the design to build and deliver one prototype for test. Testing will be conducted via bench-test in a simulated environment comparable to the anticipated operational environment at NSWC Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Beyond the ability to provide atmospheric containment removal technology to support the Submarine Escape and Rescue program, this technology could also provide benefits to all confined space emergency applications. In additional to the USN and Department of Defense (DoD), PMS391 collaboration initiatives and established Memorandum of Agreements with non-DoD federal and state emergency management organizations – to include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration (DoL-MSHA), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and National Aviation and Space Administration(NASA) – can be leveraged to address similar technology needs and requirements. Upon successful prototype testing, the technology is anticipated to be transitioned via backfit installation onboard in-service submarines and implemented as part of new construction for the USS COLUMBIA class and the future SSN(X) class of submarines.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\"Central Atmosphere Monitoring System.\" U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. 28 November 2018. https://www.nrl.navy.mil/accomplishments/materials/atmosphere-monitoring/.  \r\n\t\"Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor.\" NASA. 11 April 2018. 28 November 2018. https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/35.html.  \r\n\t“SSN 774 Class Guard Book, Disabled Submarine Survival Guide, FWD Escape Trunk (Lockout Trunk).” Naval Sea Systems Command, S9594-AP-SAR-G10, 0910-LP-018-5820, Revision 00, 27 April 2006; Change 1, ACN 2/B of 7 Feb 2019; Distribution Statement A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution is Unlimited.\r\n\r\n",

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a compact battery power, efficient uncooled kW class laser system capable of producing > 5 kW output at high atmosphere transparency wavelength.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Compact battery power uncooled kilo-watt (kW) class high energy laser (HEL) prototype systems have been deployed in a variety of platforms as laser weapons to destroy targets and threats. However, high cooling capacity chillers have to be used to dissipate the heat generated by the laser medium and pump sources of these kW-class HEL systems. The size, weight, and power (SWaP) of a HEL system is thus deteriorated by the demand of the cooling chillers on the available SWaP, which also constrains the deployment of such kW-class HEL systems in small, airborne, or unmanned weapon platforms. The DoD has a great demand for compact and robust uncooled kW-class laser system for a variety of applications. Industry will benefit as well from the reduced SWaP requirement of the technology in applications where lasers are used to cut, weld, or ablate material. This project aims to develop kW-class HEL laser sources with improved SWaP and other specifications using innovative laser technology. The Navy is looking for a kW-level laser prototype device with following specifications to be developed; Wavelength: High atmosphere transparency; Average Power Output Threshold: 3 kW (Objective: 5 kW); HEL spectrum wavelength shall be around 1 um, laser beam quality (M2) Threshold: < 1.5); Weight Threshold: 40 lbs (Objective 20 lb); Volume Threshold: 10 inch3 (Objective < 5 inch3); Air cooled compact HEL prototyped system. At present uncooled compact battery power kW class HEL system is not commercially available. \r\n\r\nThe initial prototype compact 5 kw uncooled battery power HEL system shall be evaluated at a Navy facility to understand the HEL performance and beam quality. During this test and evaluation period Navy will also evaluate the duration of the operation and the system wavelength shifts as system temperature increase. Cycle should be 5 minutes operation at full power and 5 minutes cool down. Maximum surrounding temperature equivalent to eastern summer time (80 to 85 degrees F). \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been be implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for the design of the architecture for a compact ~5 kW-class HEL prototype system that does not require an active cooling system (air cooled). Additionally, the vendor will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and power scalability of an air cooled HEL prototype system and provide the prototype design of a 5-kW prototype HEL system to NAVY. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype system in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype air cooled approximately 5kw HEL with good beam quality (M2< 2) system for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I at NAVY lab. The initial prototype compact 5 kw uncooled battery power HEL system shall be evaluated at Navy facility to understand the HEL performance and beam quality. During this test and evaluation period Navy will also evaluate the duration of the operation and the system wavelength shifts as system temperature increase. Optimize the design and scaling the Phase I laser concept to prototype a compact uncooled battery power laser system capable of producing > 5 kW output power at high atmosphere transparency wavelength that meets the requirements in the Description. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. This support is expected to be in the form of fully developing and transitioning the kW-class laser system for DoD HEL weapon systems. This technology has potential commercial transition to other applications such as industrial material processing (welding, cutting, soldering, marking, cleaning, etc.) and fundamental research.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tY.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The development of robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques for assisting the navigation of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles operating in GPS-denied environments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Despite the considerable effort directed towards UUV navigation, a self-contained solution remains a key challenge. Due to the cumulative error that an inertial navigation system (INS) experiences with time, UUVs typically require regular surfacing to obtain GPS fixes, or the presence of acoustic localization beacons, in order to correct position drift. Such options can be undesirable/unavailable in certain applications (e.g., deep-water and/or Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions). Underwater Terrain Aided Navigation (TAN) methods have also demonstrated the ability to provide accurate navigation resets, though they are limited by the requirement for accurate high-resolution reference bathymetry maps, which are not available for much of the Earth’s sea floor. In response to the presently limited navigation capability, this topic will focus on the development of robust SLAM algorithms to assist UUV navigation in GPS-denied environments. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is rapidly developing and fielding a family of Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) specifically designed for operations within GPS-denied environments. Advances in underwater sensing technology and computing power have yielded new possibilities in the underwater domain. For instance, advanced sensor processing and new underwater navigation techniques have become available, including SLAM. SLAM broadly refers to the problem of jointly creating (and updating) a map of an unknown environment and estimating the system’s position and pose within it. The topic has attracted a flurry of research in the robotics community over the past three decades, including indoor, land-based, aerial and even underwater vehicles. It has been a critical tool in the development of commercial robot vacuum systems, allowing them to operate in any home without prior knowledge of the layout. Other examples include the field of self-driving cars, where SLAM serves as a supplement to GPS navigation, allowing the system to build obstacle maps of the surrounding environment, and continue driving in unmapped areas or when GPS becomes unavailable. \r\n\r\nAlthough SLAM has been proven effective for mobile robots operating in structured environments, the application of these techniques in the highly unstructured underwater domain presents unique challenges. As a result, there is still considerable room for growth in the use of SLAM techniques for UUVs. Some examples of SLAM-based approaches for UUVs include applications for achieving improved velocity-over-ground estimates, and algorithms for improving the accuracy of bathymetric maps generated from a UUV survey. For many UUV SLAM applications, the ultimate goal is to take advantage of the process to reduce position error growth, not necessarily to generate a map of the environment. Likewise, for this topic the UUV will not need to rely on mapping its entire operational environment in order to conduct the mission. As advances in energy technology continue to increase the endurance and operating range of UUVs, missions will cover wider areas, longer distances, and longer times. It can be assumed that the target UUV system for this effort will feature a navigation-grade INS as the baseline navigation system. PMS 406, Unmanned Maritime Systems program office, seeks the development of robust SLAM algorithms that will increase the mission capabilities of such UUVs by providing additional methods for aiding vehicle navigation. The goal is to increase overall navigational accuracy during a GPS-denied mission beyond what can be achieved with just the standard Doppler Velocity Logger (DVL) aiding to the INS, and provide a means of resetting what otherwise would be unbounded position error growth. \r\n\r\nWhile initial validation of the algorithms can leverage off-line post-processing of vehicle and sensor data, the ultimate system design needs to provide output in-situ that can aid the UUV during the mission. Additionally, the solution should address the limitation of operating in areas without prior knowledge of the bathymetry or specific bottom features. Prior reference information, where available (i.e., any knowledge about natural or man-made features) can be used to enhance performance, however the system must also be capable of operating without any such assistance. \r\n\r\nThe algorithms developed should be utilized in a wide range of different environments and mission scenarios. This includes both rugged and smooth terrain, as well as cluttered and un-cluttered environments. A list of some potential Navy mission concepts and scenarios will be provided during Phase II. The system should be designed to serve as an aiding source for a UUV navigation framework based on a navigation grade INS. The solution should not be an integral piece of the UUV navigation system to the point that it needs to be operating continuously in order for the vehicle itself to navigate. Instead, the system solution encompassing the SLAM algorithms is expected to provide outputs that can be used as aiding sources into an INS framework. \r\n\r\nThe proposer will identify the available environmental information, features the algorithms aim to extract and the necessary sensors and sensor processing needed to utilize this information. The company will address how the algorithms are applicable to different UUV mission scenarios across a range of potential operational environments. The company will identify the vehicle behaviors and maneuvering necessary to utilize the algorithms and how these behaviors fit into the context of the overall vehicle mission. The concept will cover how the algorithms address areas where no prior information is available and the handling of both cluttered and un-cluttered environments. The company will identify the output data products of the algorithms and how this data aids the performance of the UUV navigation framework. \r\n\r\nIt is envisioned that the solution be tailored to aiding a UUV navigation framework based on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Inertial Navigation System. Additionally, the solution may provide a means of saving new maps generated on-board or updating existing maps stored on the system for future use. The proposer will provide a detailed plan for validating the algorithms in a computer simulation environment. This test plan should include the types of vehicle and sensor data, both historical and simulated, that would be required to carry out relevant simulation test cases, and how such data will be acquired and/or generated. Phase II shall also include the development of a plan for at-sea tests of the computer program on government-owned UUVs and a list of validation metrics for such tests. \r\n\r\nTo ensure interoperability with PMS 406 portfolio, the solution must comply with the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA). UMAA establishes a standard for common interfaces and software reuse among the mission autonomy and the various vehicle controllers, payloads, and Command and Control (C2) services in the PMS 406 portfolio of UxS vehicles. The UMAA common standard for Interface Control Documents (ICDs) mitigates the risk of vendor lock from proprietary autonomy solutions; effects cross-domain interoperability of UxS vehicles; and allows for open architecture (OA) modularity of autonomy solutions, control systems, C2, and payloads. The Navy will provide the open standards for UMAA upon award of Phase I. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will consist of a concept and feasibility determination on the implementation of SLAM-based techniques for aiding a UUV navigation system during long-duration submerged missions. Feasibility determination will describe a path for development of SLAM algorithms that leverage existing navigation-grade INS solutions and current UUV payload sensor technology to assist in managing position error drift in accordance with the requirements within the Description section of this document. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include a detailed outline for a prototype system design for implementation in Phase II and a detailed plan for validating the algorithms in a computer simulation environment. This plan should include the types of vehicle and sensor data, both historical and simulated, that would be required to carry out relevant simulation test cases, and how such data will be acquired and/or generated. Additionally, the company will develop a comprehensive summary of how the proposed solution can address the challenge of improving state-of-the-art UUV navigation systems for long-range missions.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The Phase II effort will focus on implementing the SLAM algorithms proposed and outlined in Phase I by developing and delivering a prototype system. The simulation test plan outlined in Phase I should be used for initial validation and testing of this prototype system during development. Relevant vehicle navigation and sensor data feeds, generated through playback of historical datasets and/or simulation, will be used to create suitable test cases to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. \r\n\r\nA successful Phase II project will demonstrate that the algorithms and prototype system can perform as expected using data representative of a variety of environments and deliver a detailed plan for the integration of the proposed algorithms into a software application compatible with government-owned UUV software architectures. This includes specifying a software interface compliant with the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA). It is envisioned that the solution be tailored to aiding a UUV navigation framework based on a COTS Inertial Navigation System. Additionally, the solution may provide a means of saving new maps generated on-board or updating existing maps stored on the system for future use. Phase II shall also include the development of a plan for at-sea tests of the computer program on government-owned UUVs and a list of validation metrics for such tests. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy in integrating the technology for Navy use. The proposed prototype will be integrated into the software architecture of Navy UUV systems. This includes both research-oriented UUV systems performing Science and Technology missions, as well as acquisition program UUVs conducting Navy missions at sea. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution has applicability in a wide variety of commercial as well as defense applications. Organizations that require the use of UUVs for tasks such as inspecting and repairing submerged infrastructure, searching for airplane black-boxes, conducting port and harbor security and collecting environmental data or mapping the sea floor, can leverage this technology to increase navigational and mission reliability. There are significant advantages in transitioning this technology to other DoD agencies, government, and private sector entities to enhance UUV mission capability.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPaull, Liam, et al. \"UUV navigation and localization: A review.\" IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering 39.1 (2013): 131-149. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/AUV-Navigation-and-Localization%3A-A-Review-Paull-Saeedi/b141c78f429df09b532b8c996b321eae5983f27e  \r\n\tPalomer, Albert, Pere Ridao, and David Ribas. \"Multibeam 3D underwater SLAM with probabilistic registration.\" Sensors 16.4 (2016): 560. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851074/  \r\n\tRibas, David, et al. \"Underwater SLAM in a marina environment.\" 2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Employing the latest radio frequency (RF) and digital technology, these systems have vastly improved sensitivity and increased capacity to detect, resolve, classify, and identify signals of interest as well as surveille the RF spectrum over a wide area. This increase in capacity is concurrent with the general increase in RF transmitters in the maritime environment. The RF spectrum, even in open ocean, is now far more crowded than just a few years ago. Every small craft (fishing boats, small merchantmen, patrol craft, etc.) can now afford to install commercial radar and communications equipment. The problem in navigational choke points, such as highly trafficked straits and the approaches to major ports, is severe and often complicated by the proximity of shore-based transmitters. In addition, future naval engagements will be marked by an unprecedented array of threat transmitters that use the electromagnetic spectrum. \r\n\r\nIncreased levels of EW system performance combined with the proliferation of RF transmitters (threat, friendly, and civilian) presents a significant increased burden on the EW operator (EWOP). The EWOP now has access to more electronic support (ES) information of a greater depth than ever before. Operator overload and fatigue are serious problems. While some of this data can be processed automatically by machine learning or adaptive algorithms, the Navy cannot remove the human decision-maker entirely from the loop and the EWOP remains a critical element in surface combat. Fortunately, the EWOP teams with an EW supervisor (EWSUP) to share the workload and coordinate more broadly with the combat information center. Applied effectively, the EWOP-EWSUP team is an effective element for eliminating errors, maximizing situational awareness, minimizing response times, and ensuring proper execution of EW doctrine during complex engagements. During normal operations, this teaming reduces fatigue. However, this reduction is predicated on effective organization, prioritization, and sharing of the EW battlespace information and responsibilities. This problem is similar to an air traffic control center’s organization and performance. However, air traffic control is based on a structured hierarchy of tasking, fairly predictable patterns (by intention), relatively constant workload, and cooperative “targets”. This is not the case during EW engagements and no comparable commercial application can be easily adapted for the EWOP-EWSUP team structure. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks an innovative method (realized in prototype algorithms and demonstrated on surrogate hardware and displays) to efficiently organize, prioritize, and share information and tasking between the SLQ-32 electronic warfare system EWOP and EWSUP to assure situational awareness, coordinate EW assets, and efficiently execute engagements. The solution must prioritize tasking by taking into account that the EWSUP is the senior watchstander, typically responsible for mission planning, response coordination (including countermeasures management), sensor networking and cueing, EW doctrine, and overall coordination with the combat information center. The EWSUP may also be called upon to assist in the evaluation of problematic emitters and environmental conditions. However, the solution must also be dynamic and recognize and adapt to fluctuating shifts in workload resulting from the natural progression of complex engagements. The solution must also be flexible to the addition of future EW capabilities and assets. Finally, while it is not intended that the solution include embedded training, it should accommodate embedded training by including the ability to display Surface EW Team Training (SEWTT) controls from either the EWOP or EWSUP console so that the EW Training Supervisor or instructor can monitor and manipulate (i.e., start, stop, pause, reset, add elements, etc.) embedded training scenarios while in progress. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that acceptable solutions should demonstrate a science-based knowledge of human perception, human cognition, team dynamics, and decision-making. “Hard wired” solutions that organize and manage the EWOP-EWSUP interaction based on fixed assignments and pre-prioritizations of functions are unacceptable. The goal of this effort is to complement and facilitate the relationship between the EWOP-EWSUP team in a manner that elevates their performance to a level that they could not otherwise achieve on their own. Testing will consist of controlled and monitored execution of the prototype solution with human operators utilizing surrogate display hardware. Final validation of the prototype will be demonstration of the workload sharing prototype on the surrogate display hardware, as witnessed by Government subject matter experts and program managers. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Propose a concept for an EW workload organization and sharing application that meets the objectives stated in the Description. Feasibility shall be demonstrated by a combination of analysis, modelling, simulation, and evaluation of initial workload sharing use cases. The feasibility analysis shall include predictions of operator performance in use of the application. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specification, decision trees, and capabilities description necessary to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, deliver, and demonstrate a prototype of the concept for an EW workload organization and sharing application meeting the requirements contained in the Description. A software prototype shall be demonstrated on surrogate display hardware (supplied by the performer) and delivered to the Government along with full software interface descriptions and any ancillary software needed to demonstrate the application. It should be noted that this effort may require the development and delivery of synthesized EW scenarios and emitter data to be used in demonstration of the prototype solution. Government subject matter experts and program managers will witness demonstration of the prototype technology on the surrogate display system. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Government use. Since the Phase II effort result is a prototype that is not necessarily demonstrated on a tactical system, assist in integrating the EW workload organization and sharing application into the EW display tactical code. Assist in certification of the resulting tactical code. Assist the Government in testing and validating the performance of the resulting application as integrated into the EWOP and EWSUP consoles. \r\n\r\nThe workload organization and sharing software can also be customized for additional applications such as other military systems (e.g., radar systems) and for commercial applications such as air traffic control systems, power grid control stations, train and mass transit dispatch systems, and complex security systems.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEndsley, Mica R. “Designing for Situation Awareness: An Approach to User-Centered Design, Second Edition.” Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2011. https://www.crcpress.com/Designing-for-Situation-Awareness-An-Approach-to-User-Centered-Design/Endsley/p/book/9781420063554  \r\n\tSt. John, Mark and Smallman, Harvey. “Staying Up to Speed: Four Design Principles for Maintaining and Recovering Situation Awareness.” Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making, Volume 2, Issue 2, 1 June 2008, pp. 118-139. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/155534308X284408 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Increase the reliability and confidence of laminated bus bars through the development of new insulation materials and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: DDG 1000 Class utilizes an Integrated Power System (IPS) to generate and distribute power to the propulsion system, ship service distribution system, and combat systems. Multi-layer, multi-conductor, laminated bus bars are used within the IPS system to distribute local high voltage (4160 VAC RMS) power distribution within switchboards, propulsion motors/drives, and other high voltage equipment. We currently use multi-layer, multi-conductor, laminated bus bars in the system. \r\n\r\nWhile laminated bus bars are used throughout the power industry, recent bus bar failures have highlighted the need for new technologies that will increase the reliability of bus bars in a non-sterile, shipboard environment. ASTM B187 provides guidance for copper commercial bus bars. Development areas of interest are insulation materials, conductor-connection interfaces, and associated NDT procedures. \r\n\r\nBus bars must be capable of handling various voltages, frequencies and currents dependent upon their application including maximum layer-to-layer potentials of 10.5 kV peak to ground, +/- 6500 VDC, 60A and pulse width modulation (PWM)-switched output waveforms of 3300 VAC 0-18Hz 450A. Nominal PWM switching frequency between the range of 1kHz and 20kHz. \r\n\r\nInstalled bus bars must be capable of passing qualification testing for a shipboard environment including to MIL-S-901 Grade A, Type A, Class 1 Shock, MIL-STD-167-1 Vibration, and MIL-STD-810 for Temperature and Humidity. Bus bars shall be mechanically compliant / flexible to provide excellent resistance to stresses from the above shock and vibration standards as well as installation handling. Bus bars shall meet the requirements of MIL-DTL-23928. \r\n\r\nQuality & Assurance (Q&A) processes and NDT technologies should be developed. This path will allow for the identification of insulation flaws prior to installation and the ability to verify bus bar condition through service life of current bus bars. High fidelity Q&A processes reducing the number of defective units being delivered to the fleet would increase confidence of delivered bus bars. Currently, partial discharge testing based on IEC 60270 is used to determine insulation material condition. New scanning technologies or test methods are needed to verify insulation condition which would increase confidence in in-service and spare bus bars.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for alternative insulation materials, connector interfaces, and NDT method in accordance with specifications and requirements outlined in the topic description section. Demonstrate the feasibility of the developed technology to meet the Navy’s needs through material testing. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will outline the requirements and specifications to build prototypes in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop the prototype bus bar to meet the Navy’s needs and verify in accordance with MIL-DTL-23928. Mature NDT technology and demonstrate the capability to detect bus bar insulation flaws. Demonstration/verification testing will occur at a company-provided facility. Refine the fabrication process and test procedure with a focus on creating consistent product to aid transition in Phase III. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology for Navy and potential commercial use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the bus bar technology to DDG 1000 class destroyers and future Navy high voltage systems. The final product will be capable of meeting all relevant qualification testing including shock, vibration, electromagnetic interference (EMI), humidity, and temperature. Support the development of documentation including, but not limited to; technical manuals, parts lists, drawings, training guides, and logistics documents. \r\n\r\nThe use of high voltage distribution systems and electric propulsion is becoming more frequent in the offshore and shipping industries. Reliable bus bars and the ability to verify manufacturing quality will be required to support this expansion. The technology developed to support the Navy is directly applicable to these industries and the shore-side power industry.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWang, Jianing; Yu, Yu Shaoling; Zhang, Xing. “Effect of Key Physical Structures on the Laminated Bus Bar Inductance.

Commercial AI support tools are increasingly used in industry but these tools are specific to the industry in which it is created. The tools are needed for ASW support. The modernized environment would be based on an ontology that allows for data mining and machine learning regarding issues with greatest Fleet impact, both from a standpoint of understanding the breadth and scope of impact as well as elevating the most appropriate fixes. \r\n\r\nAs the 24/7 Reachback AI Support Environment accrues information, evidence collected could drive design improvements. \r\n\r\nThe technology sought will increase mission capability by accelerating resolution of system casualties identified by sailors across the many different fielded variants. The technology will also create a Navy-wide database on which artificial intelligence and machine learning can operate to identify root causes to inform future acquisition decisions related to improving system availability. \r\n\r\nNavy surface combatants engage in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) using variants of the AN/SQQ-89, a complex system of systems composed of processing software, processing hardware, and sensitive sensor arrays. When operating properly, the ASW sensor suite gives a Fleet combatant a powerful capability to detect, classify, localize, and attack submerged threats. \r\n\r\nThe in-service and logistics infrastructure for the AN/SQQ-89 has evolved over decades, building on the Cold War sonar capability fielded in the 1950s as the AN/SQQ-26 sonar. In the two decades since the end of the Cold War, a majority of fielded AN/SQQ-89 systems were legacy systems, with problems that had remained relatively stable. \r\n\r\nInitial introduction of the A(V)15 modernization to the AN/SQQ-89 in 2009 brought modernized capabilities that the Fleet welcomed, including introduction of the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA). The A(V)15 leverages commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processing hardware. Though relatively inexpensive and very powerful from a processing standpoint, COTS infrastructure drives a relatively rapid pace of technology updates. \r\n\r\nThe rapid pace of updates required by COTS infrastructure has enabled introduction of numerous improvements. However, the proliferation of distinct variants has made the ILS challenge increasingly complex. Support personnel using infrastructure designed to support legacy baselines have identified potential for significant improvement in in-service and logistics support (ILS) outcomes should a modernized reachback capability be developed. \r\n\r\nWhen problems arise, sailors seek reachback support from ILS personnel who work 24/7 to provide timely guidance to resolve Fleet casualty reports (casreps). When new parts are required, the ILS team speeds them on their way. It is crucial that communication between the Fleet and the ILS team is robust, ensuring that the ILS specialist is 1) troubleshooting based on the proper baseline and configuration and all pertinent data; and 2) ensuring that any replacement parts are appropriate to the baseline and configuration in question. As diagnosis of many system casualties involve interaction with displays, it is important that the ILS specialist have ready access to the particular displays associated with the system the Fleet sailors are attempting to fix. \r\n\r\nThe technology will be tested using the IWS 5.0 Advanced Capability Build (ACB) step testing process. The seminal transition event will be validation by the Government that the technology performs as required. Testing will include user exploration of the tool, examination of the fault isolation capabilities and associated accuracy, and comparison of the tool menus to the tactical system menus to ensure consistency. \r\n\r\nFinally, the information accrued by the modernized reachback capability should be organized into an ontological framework that facilitates machine learning and artificial intelligence to enable analysis of casualties across the Fleet, their root causes, and prioritization of investments to make the overall system more robust. A particular challenge, required to be provided by the new tool, is providing timely and appropriate ILS for the MFTA. As a towed sensor, the MFTA operates hundreds of feet below the ocean surface, necessarily deployed and retrieved through the punishing conditions in the wake of the combatant. The OK-410 handling system associated with the MFTA, while robust, has numerous moving parts. The MFTA operates in the ocean depths where submerged threats often seek to hide, and is therefore particularly valued by the Fleet. Initial transition of the 24/7 Reachback AI Support Environment will likely focus on systems related to MFTA and other towed systems. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a 24/7 Reachback AI Support Environment that meets the requirements in the Description section. The concept will show feasibility through analytical modeling; developing and documenting infrastructure concepts; proposed ontological framework; and architectures that support both sailors, ILS specialists, and analysts. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial system specifications and a capabilities description to build a prototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype 24/7 Reachback AI Support Environment with embedded machine learning meeting the requirements for ASW as stated in the Description. Demonstrate the prototype performance across a subset of the total SQQ-89 ILS historical findings and demonstrate the prototype is fit for use by Fleet operators, ILS specialists, and acquisition analysts as discussed in the Description. If needed, coordination with the Government will occur to conduct testing at a Government or company-provided facility to validate the prototype capability. Data sets extracted from Cruiser/Destroyer casualty reports will be used to validate the prototype’s capabilities. The Government will provide the data. Demonstration of the prototype performance will take place at a Government- or company-provided facility. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use in ASW.

"topic_number": "N211-040",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Biomedical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative solution that will improve the ability to successfully accomplish single-man escape to 600 feet of seawater (fsw) of survivors from a disabled submarine and potentially increase the ability to provide safe deep escape beyond 600 fsw.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: All United States Navy (USN) submarines are provided with the equipment certified to support single-man escape of Disabled Submarine (DISSUB) survivors down to a depth of 600 fsw. This equipment is comprised of a flood valve, auto-vent valve, single-man escape suit, and an escape suit hood inflation system, among other components. \r\n\r\nThe escape trunks onboard are capable of supporting escape of two survivors (also referred to as ‘escapers’) per escape cycle. Two escapers, outfitted with escape suits, enter the escape trunk from the internal submarine compartment. After entering, the lower hatch of the escape trunk is closed and the escapers, using hood inflation valving connected to a 700-pound ship’s service air source, inflate the escape suits. The escape suits fully inflated provide up to 70 pounds of buoyancy to each escaper. This buoyancy is to allow for the rapid ascension of the escaper to the water surface to minimize the risks associated with decompression obligations. After the escape suits are fully inflated, the escape trunk flood valve is opened to fill the trunk with external seawater up to the trunk auto-vent valve. The auto-vent valve is calibrated to ensure that the flooding of the trunk stops at a pre-determined level and when the auto-vent valve fully lifts, the rapid pressurization cycle of the remaining air bubble begins. At 600 fsw, the pressurization cycle is designed to be no greater than 20 seconds before the escape trunk pressure is equalized with the external sea pressure. Once equalized, the upper hatch opens and the escapers automatically exit the upper hatch and ascend to the surface. The design of the escape suits allows the escaper to breathe normally during ascent. \r\n\r\nHuman subject testing has been successfully accomplished to prove the capability of escape down to 600 fsw. However, that testing highlighted that it is physically challenging and as the depth of the escape is increased, the risks associated with decompression obligations and mortality increase exponentially. In addition to the body’s ability to withstand the designed rapid pressurization, the ability to withstand the heat loads generated by the pressurization cycle is also of a concern. Although the mortality risk increases significantly as depths exceed 600 fsw, it is anticipated that successful escape may be achievable, based upon experimental trials and the theorized mechanical robustness of the submarine escape system and escape suits. At this time, escape protocols only allow for escape from depths greater than 600 fsw in situations when impending death is inevitable if survivors do not initiate immediate escape. Due to advances in technology and biomedical research, it may be possible to decrease the associated risk with escape from deeper depths. \r\n\r\nThe rescue of survivors from a DISSUB is the preferred method for the Navy. However, internal conditions of the DISSUB may require some, if not all, of the survivors to initiate escape in lieu of waiting for rescue forces to arrive. The time necessary to mobilize rescue forces may be in excess of the available time for survivors to remain onboard the DISSUB. Due to the risks associated with deep escape, the program office is in need of technology that will decrease the risks associated with escape to 600 fsw and potentially increase the ability to provide safe escape deeper than 600 fsw with an objective to allow for reasonable safe escape to 1000 fsw. This may involve addressing the physiological stressors associated with deep escape, the mechanical components used to accomplish escape, or a combination of both. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being a safety and duty of care issue, continued advancement and modernization of the USN Submarine Escape and Rescue Program is considered an Assistant Secretary of the Navy core field in support of the larger Undersea Warfare and directly aligns to both the National Defense Strategy and the Submarine Commander&#39;s Intent by defending the homeland, enabling interagency counterparts to advance U.S. influence and national security interests, ensuring USN submarine warfighting readiness and survivability and strengthening alliances and attracting new partners. The latter was highlighted in the geopolitical outcome following the USN Submarine Escape and Rescue response to the ARA SAN JUAN incident in November 2017.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design concept, with notional feasibility determined via computer based modeling and simulation, that will support a conceptual solution that improves the ability to escape to 600 fsw and potentially increases the ability to provide safe deep escape beyond 600 fsw. Considerations of the potential design concept should include internal compartment space constraints and minimal increase to stowage requirements, maintenance requirements, and lifecycle costs. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of the Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop a breadboard design based upon the conceptual solution, including the major components identified, to provide a representative simulation of the proposed solution. Following breadboard testing, refine, as necessary, the design to build and deliver one reduced scale prototype for testing. Due to risks associated with human subject testing, all testing accomplished will be via modeling and simulation in a computer-aided or laboratory environment. The ability to use human subjects in a lab-created or real-world environment would require approval beyond the scope of the SBIR program.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The dual use application of proposed technology is dependent upon the technology identified. However, the ability to decrease the risks associated with escape from a USN Submarine has follow-on benefits to partner ally submarine forces and other organizations who support confined space personal recovery, both within and external to the USN and DoD. Conduct further testing and certification in accordance with requirements set forth by the USN Undersea Medical community. It is anticipated that this certification will require human subject testing to be performed at the Pressurized Escape Submarine Tower (PSET) and/or Navy Experimental Dive Unit (NEDU).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“S9594-AP-SAR-G10, 0910-LP-018-5820, Revision 00, SSN 774 Class Guard Book, Distressed Submarine Survival Guide FWD Escape Trunk, Change A of 1 October 2013, ACN2/B of 7 Feb 2019. https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/11295816/774cl-fwd-guard-book-s9594-ap-sar-g10  \r\n\t“Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System Operational Requirements Document.” Chief of Naval Operations, Serial Number 489-87-98, 3 Jun 1998. https://www.navysbir.com/n21_1/N211-040-REFERENCE-2-Operational-Requirements-Document.pdf\r\n\r\n",

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a scalable, compact, high-efficiency, low-cost, cryocooler capable of operations in maritime environments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Superconductivity is a unique state of matter, where at cryogenic temperatures a material has near zero resistance allowing a large current to pass through a relatively small wire. The ability to pass large currents through the wire enable it to be used for magnetic applications. Two temperature ranges of superconducting materials exist as low temperature superconductors (LTS) and high temperature superconductors (HTS). HTS materials begin to transition from a resistive to zero resistance superconducting state around 100 K, while LTS transition begins at much colder temperatures typically below 15 K. The exact transition temperature is material specific; however, regardless of material, superconductive systems require cryogenic environments. The elevated operating temperature of HTS makes the cryogenic cooling systems orders of magnitude more efficient than LTS. \r\n\r\nThe Navy plans to use HTS in several application including degaussing operations of large surface combatant ships. These systems require large cryocoolers and are less sensitive to the impacts of cryocooler size, weight, and efficiency than tactical applications. As the Navy explores future smaller-scale applications, there are commensurate requirements for novel compact cooling solutions. One such area is the Navy&#39;s development of superconducting magnets on the order of 6\" to 24\" diameter that will require cooling to cryogenic temperatures between 20-50 K with 40-80 W of available cryogenic cooling power. These magnets can serve a multitude of different applications and may be subject to varied operational environments. \r\n\r\nCurrently, commercial cryocooler technologies exist that can provide cooling on the order of 20 W at 60 K within a total system volume of 320 in3 and mass of 6.4 kg. Configuration of these coolers allows the entire cryocooler package to fit in a 5\" diameter envelope. In addition to being small profile, these coolers boast a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 120,000 hrs, giving them excellent long-term reliability. Prior Navy developments targeted large-scale applications of superconductivity requiring cryocooling solutions from 300 to 700 W at 50 K, with targeted efficiencies of 30% of Carnot. Currently there is an order of magnitude gap in cooling capacity between COTS technology and the Navy-developed technology that attains high levels of efficiency. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is seeking technical solutions that can provide scalability to bridge the gap between the existing cryocooler technologies and the anticipated requirements to field future systems. The Navy anticipates several environmental constraints that will be imposed on the cryocooling technology including various mounting angles, changes in gravitational orientation due to platform roll and pitch, large shock forces, and operation in a high magnetic field environment, on the order of 2 T. Consequentially, any fully realized product needs to pass military shock requirements as listed in MIL-S-901D Grade A and military vibration standards established in MIL-STD-167-lA. Any product also needs to function independently of gravitational orientation (full 360 degrees, six degrees of freedom) and in the presence of magnetic fields approaching 2T. A viable solution must also be capable of operation with a range of cooling water temperatures from 4°C to 40°C. The solution should be less than 350 in3 total volume while fitting within a 6 in diameter container, weigh less than 6 kg and possesses the ability to operate where input power availability maybe greatly diminished. Therefore, designed efficiency targets should be greater than 25% of Carnot. The technical solution should include flexibility to be designed around input power that may include DC (12V, 24V, 48V), or AC (single-phase 120 V, or three-phase 440 V). The technical solution should target approximately 100 W (±20 W) of cooling at 50 K validated by experimental testing, which will include the injection of heat and temperature recording of the cryogenic space.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept and complete a feasibility analysis of the cryocooler concept to meet desired performance specifications detailed in the Description. Design and manufacturing concepts should be assessed through modeling, analysis, and benchtop testing. Size, weight, nominal performance at design as well as capacity map from no-load to 300 K, and input power shall be documented. Perform a cost estimate for both prototype development and full-scale production. The Phase I Option, if exercised, includes a detailed design and specifications to build a prototype during a Phase II effort.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, design, and fabricate a functional prototype of a compact cryocooler based on the results of the Phase I and Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) and complete characterization testing of key performance parameters at the proposer&#39;s facility or other suitable test center identified by the proposer. The designed capacity map developed in Phase I shall be updated and experimentally validated through testing of the initial prototype. Deliver the prototype to the Navy for further testing, along with maintenance and integration relevant designs and drawings. Test results, lessons learn, and design update recommendations derived from lessons learned during prototype testing shall be integrated into an additional prototype unit.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Aid in the transitioning of the technology for Navy use, as well as engage in market research, analysis, and scouting of potential industry partners to stand up production level manufacturing capabilities and facilities. The final product will be tested and verified for Navy use through the completion of qualification according to the relevant military specification and standard documents. This technology has value in any compact cryogenic application, including; to portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), and a wide variety of other applications, both commercial and military.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHawsey, R.A. and Morozumi, S. \"The Energy and Environmental Benefits of Superconducting Power Products.\" Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, vol. 10, pp. 279-306, 2005/04/01. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-005-9031-4  \r\n\tFitzpatrick, B.K.; Golda, E.M. and Kephart, J.T. \"High Temperature Superconducting Degaussing–Cooling Two HTS Coils With One Cryocooler for the Littoral Combat Ship.\" AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 985, pp. 277-283, 2008/03/16. https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2908558  \r\n\t“Datasheet: Cryotel DS 30.” Sunpower- Ametek, 2020. https://www.sunpowerinc.com/-/media/project/ameteksxa/sunpower/ameteksunpower/productdocuments/ds-30w-datasheet-sm-2.pdf?la=en  \r\n\t“MIL-S-901D Grade A, Military Specifications: Shock Tests H.I.

"topic_title": "Sensitivity and Resolution Improvements for Small-Aperture Marine RADAR",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-042",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sensors\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Achieve higher detection sensitivity and angular resolution in small-aperture marine RADAR applications.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Modern submarine navigation systems leverage commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) magnetron RADAR technology to detect moving vessels and distant shorelines. In this architecture, long-range detection sensitivity is limited by the effective radiated power (ERP) of commercially available RADAR products, many of which have been discontinued or experienced power reduction in recent years due to the emergence of low-cost broadband and pulse compression devices. Furthermore, submarine surface navigation RADAR systems must operate within a pressure proof volume (i.e., “pod”) that remains permanently mounted on a penetrating mast. There are acquisition and shipbuilding advantages to using smaller pod volumes, and therefore smaller antennas, but this comes at the expense of angular resolution, which degrades with shorter diameters. The use of large and powerful open array marine RADARs is not practical in these applications, yet International Electromagnetic Commission (IEC) standards still require strict RADAR performance against small, distant and closely spaced contacts. This puts IEC compliance out of reach for these small-aperture RADAR systems. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks innovative concepts that increase detection sensitivity and angular resolution of small aperture RADARs without breaking the pod-based sensor model. Reliable detection and resolution of navigation buoys (5 m2), small vessels (2.5 m2) and channel markers (1 m2) is required at IEC compliant ranges. The challenge is to overcome physical sensor limitations by using new architectures, innovative apertures, or digital processing to improve detection and resolution performance on these required targets. Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) algorithms can improve bearing resolution and are now available digitally in commercial marine RADAR products. Further resolution improvement is attainable using knowledge-aided DBS techniques. Sensitivity improvements are achievable using minor modifications to COTS devices. For example, the incorporation of low-noise amplifiers, coherent processing threads, or multi-static/netted sensor architectures all offer sensitivity advantages. The use of frequency and phase-modulated waveforms is shown to provide predictable improvements in processing gain and range resolution. The technology introduced by this topic will help retain navigation RADAR performance for the warfighter without forfeiting the cost and shipbuilding advantage of small and COTS-based designs. This technology is also applicable to the commercial RADAR industry as a means of reducing sensor size and improving the standard for safe navigation. \r\n\r\nIn the submarine application, the available volume for a rotating antenna is less than 20” in diameter and 8” in height. Analog-to-digital conversion must be performed within the sensor pod using a commercial RADAR processor assembly or similar small form factor device that would fit in a 20” diameter by 3” high volume. Digital RADAR video and data processing outputs will be distributed from the pod to inboard processors, so low network speeds (10 GbE or less) are preferred to enable integration with legacy platforms. Solutions that rely on commercially available components are preferred because of cost and availability, but not required. Digital processing capabilities must be implemented on Government-furnished servers or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) using open interface standards to allow periodic and modular software/firmware upgrades. \r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct innovative research, design, and modelling to demonstrate the proof of concept. Evaluate the feasibility of using the concept to improve sensitivity and resolution of small-aperture X-band RADAR. The concept shall include simulated performance analysis, performance estimates for achievable angle resolution, and range of first detection of required targets identified in the Description Section. Develop system architecture diagrams to identify technical challenges, risks, and any cost/performance trades associated with the technology. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include development of the capability description, design specifications, and performance requirements for a Phase II prototype.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Mature the concept by building and testing a functional prototype based on the Phase I design and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). Conduct demonstrations and collect measurements in simulated and over-water environments to validate the prototype. Ideally, Phase II testing will consist of field measurements that demonstrate the ability to meet Phase I performance predictions and applicable IEC 62388 performance metrics in a relevant over-water environment. Controlled laboratory experiments may also be used to verify and validate performance estimates where field measurements are not practical. Develop a transition plan for technical insertion on Navy platforms, and report on the overall commerciality and suitability of the prototype for tactical fielding. Transition the final solution to appropriate platforms and end users.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition the concept from prototype development to full production. The final design will be produced with tactical form, fit and function. Factory acceptance testing is expected to formally verify system performance and survivability against MIL-STD-167-1A, MIL-STD-461F, MIL-STD-464C, and MIL-STD-810G environmental standards. \r\n\r\nThe targeted platforms for Phase III transition are VIRGINIA and COLUMBIA class submarines, and so a temporary alterations (TEMPALT) fielding may also be used to reduce production technical risks. While the primary motivation for this technology is to improve performance of military marine RADARs, commercial applications also exist in any industry where a sensor aperture is limited by physical constraints, for example, small aperture RADARs are used in modern automobiles to automatically detect and resolve moving objects, predict collisions, and assist in driver decision making. Similarly, the use of commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has gained interest in many service industries. The technology described in this topic can be used to improve the performance of electromagnetic sensors in these non-military applications.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKazimierski, Witold and Stateczny, Andrzej. “Analysis of Beam Sharpening Effectiveness in Broadband Radar on Inland Waters.” 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS), Dresden, Germany, Volume: pp. 870-875, June 2015. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283150133_Analysis_of_Beam_Sharpening_Effectiveness_in_Broadband_Radar_on_Inland_Waters  \r\n\tChen, Hongmen et al. “Knowledge-Aided Doppler Beam Sharpening Super-Resolution Imaging by Exploiting the Spatial Continuity Information.” Sensors (Basel). 2019 Apr; 19(8): 1920. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6514580/  \r\n\tAbdelbagi, Hamid Eltayib. “FPGA-Based Coherent Doppler Processor for Marine RADAR.” Thesis, University of Dayton, School of Engineering, May 2016. https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=dayton1461182845&disposition=inline  \r\n\tKilani, Moez Ben. “Multistatic Radar Optimization for Radar Sensor Network Applications.” Thesis, University of Quebec, April 30, 2018. http://espace.etsmtl.ca/2115/1/BEN%20KILANI_Moez.pdf   \r\n\tZhang, Bin; Hua, Dong and Tong, Liu. “Research on marine solid state radar and its application.” IEEE Xplore Digital Library. 2013 Third World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies (WICT 2013), February 3, 2020. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7113098 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_number": "N211-043",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Machine Learning/AI\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an Intelligent Corrosion Simulation and Design Tool that will read Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings, select the corrosion modes that the materials are likely to encounter, and assign the service environment to the selected computational engine.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Currently available commercial options for computational corrosion modeling are based on modeling approaches that require detailed materials science knowledge for the end users, apply narrowly focused subset of relevant corrosion modes for materials of interest, and are not context sensitive to select which modes of corrosion are most likely for materials of interest. \r\n\r\nThe cost of corrosion to the Naval fleet exceeds $9.5B/year, with 40% of that cost avoidable with improved corrosion design. The current state of the art for computational corrosion simulations requires the end user to have advanced knowledge of materials science, service environment chemistry and corrosion countermeasure options. Designing warship subsystems for corrosion cost avoidance requires detailed knowledge of construction material performance to each mode of corrosion damage, service environments in which the materials are intended to be used, available corrosion countermeasure technologies, and ownership costs associated with these decisions. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks development of an intelligent modeling environment, which is agnostic to the source of materials properties data allowing user-definable corrosion materials properties, user-definable corrosion modes/mechanisms, user-definable behavioral relationships between properties & environmental stressors; and provides an integrating platform to connect these corrosion modes/mechanisms to specific materials & geometries read from Computer Aided Design (CAD) data inputs. This would create a corrosion information ecosystem allowing corrosion behavior modes/mechanism relationships to be developed under a technical community crowd-sourcing paradigm, and aid in the development of an integrated Naval corrosion simulation paradigm. The Navy intends to leverage the skills and expertise of a broad base of materials science specialists from academia, industry, and DoD subject matter experts in creating a diverse toolbox of available corrosion simulation engines. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this SBIR topic is to create an intelligent corrosion tool that can store (and retrieve) a complex dataset along with key materials information and use cases that would trigger selection of specific corrosion simulation engine. The tool would also create an interface to assemble the information from a designer’s CAD drawing/modeling environment in order to implement the proper corrosion simulation engine. Specifically, the tool must adequately incorporate modules that accommodate: (1) the materials of interest, derived from CAD packages, (2) the service environment corrosion severity, (3) mechanisms of material corrosion and driving physical parameters for such, and (4) handoff parameters for incorporating these mechanisms into external modeling codes. \r\n\r\nImplementing advanced analytics into warship design requires simplifying access to the simulation engines that can perform these analyses. This intelligent tool will have the capacity to read a designer’s drawing and extract the key information parameters that may be required to hand over to a corrosion simulation engine. The tool will have capabilities to down select which CAD dimensions, materials, coatings, corrosion countermeasures, etc. are required to evaluate the design against a specific mode of corrosion attack. The tool will also house a cursory analysis module that allows a design engineer to evaluate which modes of corrosion attack are most likely in the specified design, prior to conducting rigorous simulations to determine their severities. \r\n\r\nThis effort will leverage the Navy-owned materials database as well as materials data or behavioral characteristics to the corrosion database from academia, industries and DoD partners through an interface provided by the developer. The intelligent tool will have clear guidelines on how the data or algorithm must be implemented to be of value to the Navy and provide a means to assess cost avoidance through improved design changes. \r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n\r\n1) Develop a concept for an Intelligent Corrosion Tool that will develop and demonstrate a computational database architecture that can store and retrieve user-specified material properties and behavior equations for specific materials corrosion modes; and is searchable in context of the material, corrosion mode, corrosivity of the environment, and other user-definable contextual parameters. \r\n\r\n2) Demonstrate the ability to gather key geometry and materials information from a component drawing file, reading Standard Triangle Language (STL)-based drawings designed in commercial CAD software. \r\n\r\n3) Allow designation of a “Service Zone” or “Service Environment” based on selecting service parameters from a diagram of a ship/submarine diagram where the component is intended to operate or corrosion severity zone selection. Extract and assemble key information required to exercise corrosion simulation models. \r\n\r\n4) Demonstrate the ability to read multiple CAD drawings, identify materials and potential corrosion modes, automatically prepare model preprocessing files, and interface files for commercial modeling tools including geometry and modeling parameters. \r\n\r\n5) Demonstrate the ability to capture cost avoidance data from corrosion countermeasures simulation results. \r\n\r\n6) Incorporate logic to evaluate drawings/designs against the US Navy’s Corrosion Control and Design Criteria Manual – a wide ranging design document that outlines best practices for robust designs and corrosion cost avoidance. \r\n\r\nAs part of Phase III, the products will be included in the anticipated Future Naval Capability (FNC) program as a key component that can be utilized by ship designers to enable corrosion-informed materials selection and design.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a tool that will satisfy requirements 1, 2, and 3 in the Description. \r\n\r\nPerform testing and certification using materials properties and drawings supplied by the Navy. Demonstration must include exercising the Intelligent Corrosion Tool against a prototypical working CAD model of a section of the ship’s hull and cathodic protection system to capture corrosion interactions between wetted materials. The Intelligent Corrosion Tool will then return this information to the user in a distilled format. Phase I Option, if exercised, would include the initial layout and capabilities description to build the unit in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of the Phase I and Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop the Intelligent Corrosion Tool that incorporates requirements 4, 5, and 6 in the Description. \r\n\r\nTesting and verification for the tool will include analysis of prototypical CAD drawings and comparison against the user-provided materials properties/corrosion modes database. Successful outcomes will involve selecting multiple potential corrosion modes for the materials and geometries included in the CAD drawings, and down select the most likely corrosion mechanism occurrences in the presented scenarios based on the CAD drawings and user-supplied materials database. The tool will then compile the necessary information in order to hand off corrosion mode simulations to commercial/Navy specific analytical packages that are consumers of pre-packaged information provided by the Intelligent Corrosion Tool.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Dual Use Applications for the Intelligent Corrosion Tool will naturally evolve from a demonstrated ability to incorporate corrosion cost avoidance into design practices. Engineering design processes for naval warships are similar to engineering design processes for non-military vessels, and many partners that design/build components for the Naval fleet also design/build components for non-military customers, such as automotive, aerospace, oil & gas, and piping industries.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTaylor, Christopher. “Corrosion Informatics: An Integrated Approach to Modeling Corrosion.” Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1179/1743278215Y.0000000012  \r\n\tKoch, G., Ayello, F., Sridhar, N., Khare, V., Al-Mathen, A.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop technology that will advance traditional submarine design toward accommodating an Inflatable Deployable Sail System (IDSS) for future submarines.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: A submarine designed without a sail would have inherent advantages in submerged operations over a design with a sail in the areas of speed, maneuverability, and acoustic stealth. However, until a solution can be found to safely navigate a submarine without the height of eye and visibility afforded by a sail, no such design can be entertained. Advances in inflatable structures can provide the freeboard needed for surface transit with a temporary and reusable structure. Maturation of this technology will open up the SSN(X) design space to entertain submarines that can operate submerged without the impediments of a sail. \r\n\r\nThe submarine sail is an integrated structural platform that hosts various Undersea Warfare (USW) systems and equipment including periscopes; communication antenna masts; acoustic, electromagnetic and radar sensor systems; exhaust ports; and crew access/escape trunks. The sail connects the bridge to a secondary (non-pressure) hull that, in turn, connects to the pressure (primary) hull. Crew hatches are positioned at each boundary interface along the sail access/escape trunk. The sail vertically offsets the bridge from the primary hull to provide a specified freeboard. Each submarine class in today’s USN Fleet incorporates a fixed rigid sail structure. These traditional sail structures provide a manned bridge that enables the crew to command, communicate and control operations remotely from the internal control room while affording necessary height of eye and on-ship visibility to facilitate surface transits. The sail structure also provides freeboard necessary to enable vertical and underway replenishment (VERTREP and UNREP, respectively) operations without flooding the primary hull. \r\n\r\nSail geometries are optimized for their hydrodynamic performance to minimize flow-induced noise, vibrations and wake effects by using faired leading and trailing edges and, for specific class variants, optional cusp fairings. Unlike the Seawolf, Virginia, and improved Los Angeles class submarines, variants such as the Ohio, original Los Angeles, and Columbia classes incorporate articulating dive planes external to the sail. \r\n\r\nThe structural loadings, deployment/retrieval operations and stability mechanisms required present significant design and material challenges for an inflatable and deployable sail. NAVSEA’s design objectives for future submarines are to explore and innovate sail concepts, including development toward achieving an Inflatable and on-demand Deployable Sail System (IDSS) that is capable of controlled deployment from and stowage inside the secondary hull. The IDSS shall primarily be used for manned bridge operations with a crew access/escape trunk only and will not house the aforementioned USW systems and related equipment. \r\n\r\nThere are many dimensional and configuration constraints exist for IDSS: The sail dimensions for deployable assembly should have a minimum 16-ft freeboard (other dimensions as necessary for manned bridge capabilities that match current submarine sails); Crew bridge capacity should be at a minimum of 2 crew shoulder-to-shoulder forward of bridge hatch with minimum of 2 crew shoulder-to-shoulder rear of bridge hatch; Bridge and pressure hull hatches should be 30-inch inner diameter; Bridge should have power, lighting and communications (from pressure hull to bridge) and conduits, flip-up windshield, storage lockers, etc.; Crew access/escape trunk (connects pressure hull hatch to bridge hatch), include ladder system; Wave slap should have uniform pressure loading; Bridge weight should be 4,000-lbs maximum; Sail external vertical loads must include weight of ice, etc.; Ice and foreign object impact protection; Ballistic protection (small arms fire); Positive locking stowage configuration. \r\n\r\nThe minimum operational constraints for IDSS are: Inflatable actuation (potable water, seawater, air/water combination); Operational cycles of 10,000, Deploy/stow at 0.0 knots from periscope depth with cross flow of 5.0 knots; Maintain shape at periscope depth in cross flow velocity of 5 knots; Deploy/stow at surface at vessel speed of 5.0 knots; Deploy/stow during range of sea states (operational to SS6, survivable to SS8); Provide pressure relief for internal pressure exceeding 2.5x ambient pressure within 5.0 seconds; Safety factors for inflatable components: 4.0; Deployment time of 1.0 minute; Stowage time of 1.0 minute; Deflection limits at full deployment shall be 5.0-inches yaw, pitch, roll with respect from bridge to secondary hull (existing fixed sails are stress-limited); and Temperature range of -60°F to 150°F. \r\n\r\nThe current state of inflatable soft structures technologies can provide unique solutions to the many challenges limiting today’s USW operations, capabilities and system designs. Inflatable soft structures have been successfully developed for DoD, NASA, and industry and are generally categorized in the following sectors: Inflatable control surfaces, deployable energy absorbers, and temporary on-demand structures. \r\n\r\nSuccessful design and performance of soft inflatable structures is attributed to technological advancements derived from: High Performance Fibers (HPF) including, but not limited to, Vectran®, DSP® (dimensionally stable polyester), PEN (polyethylene napthalate), Spectra® (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene), Kevlar®; Novel fabric architectures and 3-dimensional woven preforms capable of unique mechanical behaviors; Continuous weaving processes for elimination of seams in inflatable structures; Robust Physics-Based Modeling (PBM) methods with Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) capabilities including FEA and CFD; and material test methods for characterization of multi-axial and pressure-dependent mechanical behaviors for inputs to numerical models. \r\n\r\nCollectively, these advancements have established a sound technology base; one that can be leveraged for innovative solutions to soft structure designs requiring significant load-carrying capacities, shock mitigation, dynamic energy absorption, rapid deployment, large deployed-to-stowed volume ratios, and fail-safe modes of operations. \r\n\r\nThe Inflatable Deployable Sail Structure (IDSS) shall consist of a generally soft or soft/rigid hybrid inflatable structure with a rigid or hybrid rigid/inflatable bridge. The IDSS will connect to the submarine’s seawater pump interface (SPI) and air flask interface (AFI). The tube seawater pump and air flask shall be used to control inflation and deflation of the IDSS with seawater and air as the possible inflation media. \r\n\r\nThe soft structures considered for use in developing the IDSS may include, but are not limited to, control volumes constructed of inflated membranes, 3-D woven preforms, flexible bladders, coated fabrics, and hybrid (soft/rigid) material systems, and hard goods-to-soft goods connections. Hybrid inflatables may include inflatable elements with semi- or fully-rigid reinforcements serving as deployment shaping controls, and abrasion resistant contact surfaces. The pressurization media for all inflatable components will be limited to seawater and air. \r\n\r\nStructural testing of the IDSS concept shall be required to validate the operational performance and resistance to wave slap loading using a full-scale IDSS prototype and in accordance with stated objectives using air, water, or both as the inflation media. The tests shall demonstrate: \r\n\r\nTest-1: deployment from the stowed to the fully deployed (operational) configuration. \r\n\r\nTest-2: resistance to wave slap and impact loadings along the port and starboard athwart ship directions and the fore and aft longitudinal directions when fully deployed. \r\n\r\nTest-3: retrieval from the fully deployed configuration to the stowed configuration. \r\n\r\nThe company shall identify recognized issues and propose resolutions affecting operational performance and reliability, crew and system safety, environmental exposure effects (temperature, cyclic fatigue, UV, abrasion, puncture, impact, biofouling, chemical/biological, etc.) and maintenance concerns including crew accessibility and repair methods. Failure modes effects analyses (FMEA) shall be performed for the primary structural and inflatable components. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Create a virtual design concept for an IDSS including a Concept Feasibility Analysis (CFA). The CFA shall assess the IDSS concept using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to characterize the structural response and stability for hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, wave slap, ice and foreign object impact loading events. Additionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling shall analyze the hydrodynamic and flow noise/vibrations responses. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build and test a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Optimize the IDSS design based on the results of the Phase I and Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) including material selections for the soft structural components, pneumatic/hydraulic layout design and manifolding, inflation/deflation sequencing, porting to the submarine’s seawater interface pump and air supply flask, hard-to-soft-goods connections, power, data and lighting connections to the pressure hull, environmental factors. Identify and document all operational, safety, environmental and maintenance issues as recognized during development of the proposed IDSS design. Perform risk identifications, risk assessments, and risk mitigation plans from the concept development stage. \r\n\r\nBuild a full-scale structural prototype of the proposed IDSS and test to validate the above requirements. Correlate the results of models developed to those obtained from the prototype tests, including deflections, reaction forces and the pressure-time histories for each inflated component and loading direction. \r\n\r\nDeliver the prototype IDSS to the NAVSEA designated Warfare Center(s) for testing in accordance with the stated operational requirements. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The technologies are applicable to future underwater weapons, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), and commercial/industrial dual use. All technologies including designs, material data, manufacturing methods, prototype test results, etc. developed under this topic shall be transferred to the Navy for transition to future submarines, UUVs, USVs and underwater weapons. Potential commercial applications include adaptable and deployable structures for the construction industry, Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) ships, space vehicle structures (including deployable control surfaces) and habitats, civil infrastructure protective systems (land, air and port barriers; levee sealing and erosion repair), chemical/biological containment systems for internal use aboard aircraft and mass transit ground vehicles, blast/shock mitigation and impact energy absorption devices), and maritime safety systems (rescue and buoyant recovery platforms).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBurcher, R. and Rydill, L. “Concepts in Submarine Design.” Cambridge Ocean Technology Series, Cambridge University Press, 1994. https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Submarine-Design-Cambridge-Technology/dp/052155926X  \r\n\tHulton, A., Cavallaro, P. and Hart.

"topic_number": "N211-045",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an extended life, low maintenance, affordable aircraft deck tie down fitting for aircraft carrier applications.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Aircraft securing fittings (commonly refer to as “deck tie-down fittings”) as part of flight deck provides an attachment point for onboard aircrafts (i.e., fighter jets, auxiliary planes, helicopters) to prevent movement of aircraft, equipment, or materials due to ship movement and wind. It is essential that the aircraft and equipment be secured in a manner to prevent motion in all directions aboard the ship. Depending on the sea state and weather condition, on average 4 to 12 deck tie-down securing points are used for securing an aircraft. A typical configuration of a deck tie down fitting assembly consists of a crossbar welded onto a fitting cup, which is typically manufactured from heat treatable low alloy steel, and welded onto the flight deck. In aircraft carrier applications, a five-crossbar type tie down fitting is welded directly onto a deck, which is the application of focus under this SBIR topic. \r\n\r\nFor corrosion protection from marine environment, a coating of military specification grade polyamide epoxy primer is applied on both the crossbar and fitting/deck, post installation; however, due to a constricted access point for paint application and exposure to heavy abrasion during service, the coating is prone to damage. As a result, the corrosion and abrasion of the steel flight deck tie down assembly, especially on the crossbar, has been a persistent issue, leading to severe degradation on ship readiness and increased maintenance burden. A more durable flight deck tie-down fitting needs to be developed for the aircraft carrier application. Durability of the new flight deck tie down fitting must be able to withstand the corrosive marine environment, abrasion and impact from the securing hook and support a significant reduction in maintenance requirements than the current version of the deck tie down fittings to reduce the maintenance burden. The new flight deck tie down fitting must be affordable to support a reduction in total ownership cost during its life cycle. The affordability needs to be addressed both on the material and labor cost front, for the overall economic feasibility. \r\n\r\nThere are several types of Navy-approved aircraft secure tie down fittings conforming to NAVSEA Drawing 803-1916300 (Hull Standard Drawing Aircraft Securing and Engine Run–Up Fittings). On aircraft carriers, five crossbar fitting Type VIII is installed for providing an additional pull strength for securing aircrafts and equipment aboard the carrier. Type VIII tie down fittings are welded onto the deck, instead of welding onto a fitting cup as previously mentioned. Dimensions and requirements data for deck tie down fittings are covered under the referenced NAVSEA drawing. This NAVSEA drawing is not available on internet on public domain; however, a commercial version of this specific tie down fitting is available through a commercial vendor and their relevant design information [Ref 1]. It is noted that the referenced NAVSEA drawing (803-1916300) supersedes any existing discrepancy on dimensions and design requirements between the two drawings. Replacement of a failed or degraded secure fitting is a significant driver for cost and maintenance burden due to the high number of flight deck tie down fittings installed and the required replacement rate of several hundred tie down fittings for supporting mission operation and readiness. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is seeking a more durable (e.g., fabricated from a material that is more resistant to corrosion and abrasion than current steel when exposed to seawater and marine environment) deck tie down fitting that would support a form, fit, function replacement of the legacy steel tie down fittings (five crossbar Type VIII version only) on aircraft carriers. This also includes replacement of the two deck lugs installed between the two crossbars for each tie down fitting installed on landing areas of the flight deck with the same corrosion resistance and durable lugs. \r\n\r\nThe Navy requires tie down fittings that have similar strength as the current fittings (4130 grade steel), are also resistant to corrosion, and wear for a minimum service life of 25 years or more with desirable target of 50 years for supporting entire life cycle of an aircraft carrier. While in service, 100% of the tie down fittings are inspected with a go/no-go gauge per Navy maintenance inspection procedure. The go/no-go gauge is intended to inspect for a reduction in thickness of the crossbar below the required minimum level due to degradation from corrosion and wear/tear while in service. \r\n\r\nDimensions: For this SBIR topic, the only applicable flight deck tie down fitting is five crossbar Type VIII, which is the most common type installed on aircraft carriers. The commercial equivalent of Type VIII and the relevant design parameter is available for access and view online through the commercial vendor’s website. Due to limitation of flight deck configuration, increase or scaling up of the tie down fitting design cannot be supported and will not be considered as a potential solution. \r\n\r\nLoad: Refer to the flight deck tie down fitting pull test requirements in System Requirements section above. \r\n\r\nShock: N/A as flight deck tie down fitting is considered as a part of the overall ship structure and not subjected to a separate shock requirement. \r\n\r\nVibration: N/A as flight deck tie down fitting is considered as a part of the overall ship structure and not subjected to a separate vibration requirement. \r\n\r\nWelding: Cross member material must be compatible to be welded/joined to high strength steel and minimal heat control processing to support in service replacement. In order to meet the minimum heat control-processing requirement, material selection consideration must include a base material/filler metal not subject to heat-affected zone hardenability and hydrogen cracking. Final weld to meet nondestructive testing, such as visual and dye penetrant inspection to acceptance standards, and load testing are requirements for a successful tie down fitting. Minimum requirements for the fabrication and welding design for ship structures are covered in MIL-STD-1689 and provides general welding and inspection requirements for the tie down fittings.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a corrosion resistant and durable aircraft deck tie down fittings for aircraft carrier application. Describe how the technology will be implemented, provides cost ranges for the systems, and provides notional shipboard implementation. Conduct both literature review and testing of material properties to meet various Navy requirements. (Note: Navy can provide guidance document to selected performers.) Establish feasibility by material testing and/or through analytical modeling. Phase I Option, if exercised, should include the initial specifications and capabilities for the technology to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Produce 15 prototype aircraft securing fittings for delivery and evaluation to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW and the Navy requirements specified under NAVSEA Drawing 803-1916300 (Hull Standard Drawing Aircraft Securing and Engine Run–Up Fittings). Ensure that the prototype material can be welded to high strength steel with qualified welding procedures in accordance with the appropriate Navy specific requirements for welding on high strength material. Demonstrate performance through prototype evaluation and testing over the required range of parameters (i.e., accelerated corrosion, wear, weld-ability, and mechanical properties) including numerous deployment cycles to verify test results. For mechanical properties, ensure that the fitting satisfies the pull strength requirement specified in the NAVSEA Drawing 803-1916300 applicable to Type VIII tie down. Using the evaluation results, refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet Navy requirements. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology for Navy use.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy use. Support the Navy for test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Navy use. The technology must be transitioned to the aircraft carrier platform. \r\n\r\nThis technology may also reduce maintenance and operations costs for commercial ships and aviation. Government and commercial space programs may also benefit from adopting the technology.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTie down Fitting Part Number: PH285P-8, Peck & Hale LLC Product Page. https://www.peckhale.com/products/ph285p-8  \r\n\tMIL-STD-1689 Rev A, (1990). https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=37098 \r\n\r\n",

USW-DSS uses both live data and constructed or simulated data to create a live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) modeling and simulation (M&S) capability for Theater ASW planning and analysis of mission execution. \r\n\r\nUSW-DSS contains applications for environmental analysis, collaborative search planning, force management, sharing of a common tactical picture with networked tactical decision aids, sensor tracks and sensor metrics, automated and manual cross-platform track fusion, search execution measures of effectiveness, graphics storage, recall, and ASW briefing support. The applications also improve effectiveness by decreasing the time required to search an area to a desired probability of detection. \r\n\r\nCurrently, a universal data adapter for deployed systems is not commercially available; However, there is a similar solution in the training and M&S communities. It is IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). DIS is commonly used as a standard for conducting real-time platform level war-gaming. In order to participate in LVC event, a data adapter is usually developed to bridge the communication between platforms. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks a solution for an automated coalition data parser and 4D display application that may be shared with foreign partners. The data to be exchanged include environmental information (such as local sound speed profiles, ambient noise measurements), data that informs search planning and force management (such as ship speed and maneuvering characteristics, fuel availability and consumption, ASW sensor health and system capabilities), data to generate common tactical pictures, output from tactical decision aids, tracked contacts, search execution measures of effectiveness, and graphics required to generate ASW briefing materials.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-047",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop decision-making algorithms and planning software that can recommend UUV mission plans satisfying operator-defined mission goals and priorities by proposing joint UUV-path plans and sensor-usage schedules that optimize the UUV’s energy-usage efficiency over an entire mission.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are energy-constrained platforms that execute complex missions in dynamic, and often unpredictable, environments. The advent of advanced sensing payloads and the Navy’s interest to extend the operational lifetime of UUVs demand advanced, dynamic, UUV mission-planning tools that go beyond path-planning optimization and “static” mission objectives alone. In particular, there is a need to optimize UUV mission plans based on prioritized objectives with respect to path plans, sensor usage, and energy consumption while ensuring that prioritized mission objectives continue to be satisfied. Most UUV mission planning tools available today rely on models that quantify sensor coverage and energy consumption to define a ‘static’ mission plan prior to starting the mission. These plans often predefine the power budget for the UUV and its payloads, and guarantee an ample energy reserve for UUV emergency procedures. Missions are, however, dynamic in nature and the corresponding mission plans should be revaluated and optimized on-board the UUV during mission execution. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is looking for mission-effectiveness optimization algorithms that leverage classical control, optimization techniques, and modern artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to develop software tools able to dynamically recommend UUV routes and sensor-usage schedules. The proposed energy usage schedule must account for the UUV’s energy usage over the entire mission and dynamically adjust the schedule according to the mission requirements. The proposed algorithms must also define clear mission-objective satisfaction metrics for assessing mission effectiveness as a function of the mission priorities, the sensor-payload activation schedule, and the overall energy consumption of the UUV. The software implementation of these algorithms should provide the initial mission plan (i.e., route, and sensor operating modes and activation schedules); support on-board monitoring of the UUV’s energy usage across the navigation and sensor payloads; evaluate the path and schedule effectiveness with respect to mission objectives of the sensor payload activations along the planned UUV route in real-time on-board the UUV; and dynamically recommend changes to the current mission plan to maximize mission effectiveness. It is critical that any decision-making approach executed on-board the UUV in response to the dynamics of the mission and the environment to redefine the mission plan can be executed efficiently and within predefined computational and power-usage constraints demarcated by the UUV’s internal configuration. \r\n\r\nTo ensure interoperability with the PMS 406 portfolio, the software solution must comply with the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA). UMAA establishes a standard for common interfaces and software reuse among the mission autonomy and the various vehicle controllers, payloads, and Command and Control (C2) services in the PMS 406 portfolio of Unmanned Systems (UxS) vehicles. The UMAA common standard for Interface Control Documents (ICDs) mitigates the risk of vendor lock from proprietary autonomy solutions; effects cross-domain interoperability of UxS vehicles; and allows for open architecture (OA) modularity of autonomy solutions, control systems, C2, and payloads. The Navy will provide the open standards for UMAA upon award of Phase I. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may require access to classified information and become classified. Note that the prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been be implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected contractor will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a software-system concept with dynamically reconfigurable routing and sensor-usage schedule algorithms to maximize UUV mission effectiveness by making efficient use of the available energy. Quantify expected energy-usage efficiency improvements and their impact on UUV mission execution, e.g., duration and increased sensor duty cycles, and vehicle configuration, e.g., reduced battery size. Conduct simulations using realistic scenarios and surrogate UUV autonomous control systems to demonstrate and quantify mission effectiveness improvements to demonstrate feasibility of the concept. The software products completed during this phase should be sufficient to demonstrate the implementation feasibility of algorithms, with corresponding software modules interfaced with surrogate UUV autonomous control systems that optimize planning, execution, and energy usage on UUVs to achieve maximum mission effectiveness. The Phase I Option, if exercised, would include the initial layout and capabilities description to build the unit in Phase II. Notional computational and power-usage constraints for select classes of UUVs will be identified in this Phase by the performer in collaboration with PMS 406.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Prior to starting prototype development, performers must identify and discuss with PMS406 the following items: (i) target UUV, access requirements and availability; (ii) UUV autonomy framework and required documentation; (iii) computational and power-usage constraints applied to the targeted UUV (leveraging Phase I analysis); and, (iv) approach for accessing the UUV and all related information needed. Develop a full-scale system prototype that can generate initial mission plans that maximize mission effectiveness and dynamically quantify their effectiveness in realistic mine countermeasure (MCM) scenarios (both real world and simulated). Conduct test and evaluation of the system prototype to quantify UUV-mission-effectiveness improvements. Demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the prototype system with one or more UUV autonomy systems using either a real UUV or a high-fidelity software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation. Conduct extensive test and evaluation to quantify the UUV mission effectiveness improvements from dynamic mission optimization in realistic MCM mission scenarios with successful demonstration showing that the software can be used on-board a UUV to maximize mission effectiveness without significantly overburdening the computational resources available within the UUV. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that portions of the work under this effort could be classified under Phase II or Phase III (see Description Section).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: To ensure interoperability with the PMS 406 portfolio, refine the system solution to comply with the UMAA.

Current systems rely heavily on manual association of contact information across sensors. This can be challenging in cluttered environments. Sensor improvements (resulting in more arrays, more gain, more beams, etc.) compound the problem, which can in turn lead to a degradation in situational awareness, incorrect contact picture, and possibly loss of tactical control. \r\n\r\nThe variable nature of the ocean floor, changing currents, unpredictable water temperature and density layers, marine life, and a huge spectrum of vessel traffic create a highly complex tactical picture in which an adversary can hide. Multiple specialized and highly sensitive sensors have been deployed over the years to contend with these conditions and fully penetrate the undersea battlespace. However, under stressing conditions and, taken collectively, the array of sensors employed by the undersea warfighter yields a copious flow of data and information that must be rapidly analyzed and interpreted. A multi-sensor fusion technology is needed to generate a unified and consistent tactical picture. The solution must be capable of analyzing, assimilating, and fusing data in an approach that considers both coherent and incoherent processing across multiple sensors with utilization of kinematic and spectral information in order to generate a single, unified, decision-quality, tactical picture. \r\n\r\nWhile the technology sought under this topic will need to comply with cybersecurity protocols, cybersecurity, per se, is not necessarily required as an embedded aspect of the solution provided. While ideally fusion would involve multiple sensors having simultaneous contact, there will be times when only one sensor has contact. The fusion desired is an overarching awareness of contacts as they are perceived by different sensors and modes, both when there is temporal overlap and when there is not temporal overlap. \r\n\r\nDuring Phase II, the technology will be evaluated by Navy subject matter experts and Fleet operators in a prototype sonar system using at-sea test data for validation. It may also be evaluated in an unmanned operation if appropriate for the solution. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

In this area, the Navy has reviewed recent advances in VBG technologies that enabled key improvements of high efficiency grating properties and led to development of unique VBG-based optical filters for RAMAN spectroscopy and other applications. Currently commercial VBG operates with laser beams that have only narrow band (< 1 nm) linewidth for spectral beam combination At present narrow linewidth (< 1 nm) KW class CW laser are very expensive.. Broad linewidths around 5 nm are more stable and cost-effective. Spectral beam combination (SBC) using current VBG is limited to its operating at spectral range. The proposed broadband VBG can combine multi wavelengths within 200nm bandwidth and has the potential to increase power > MW in a very cost-effective approach to fabricate high-energy laser (HEL) for navy battle space supremacy. The proposed broadband grating (> 200 nm) shall be able to increase laser power greater than MW class using spectral beam combination and shall also have high damage threshold to compress the high peak power (> GW) femtosecond laser. \r\n\r\nVBGs in photo-thermo-reflective (PTR) glass has been used for various applications, such as longitudinal and transverse mode selection in diode, solid-state laser resonators, stretchers and compressors for picosecond and femtosecond lasers, and mirrors for high brightness dense spectral beam combining angular beam deflectors/magnifiers. Theoretical and experimental studies of VBGs, their properties and the possibility to make much thicker VBGs in PTR glass compared to polymer-based materials or thin oxide and semiconductor films allow for fabrication of optical filters with linewidths orders of magnitude narrower than those by other techniques. \r\n\r\nVolume Bragg Gratings (VBGs) have become an essential component of high-power laser technologies by allowing SBC, stretching and compression of ultrashort laser pulses, frequency stabilization, etc. An innovative compact efficient VBG technology has potential applications due to its high efficiency and high-power laser-radiation damage threshold. However, their high efficiency is limited to a narrow spectral bandwidth, and is typically accompanied by a narrow angular bandwidth. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks an innovative compact, efficient high-power Volume Bragg Grating (VBG) that could exhibit near 99% optical efficiency in broad bands of spectrum (> 200 nm) at 1 to 2 µm optical wavelength. Of particular interest are infrared operation wavelength with a broad spectral range of angles, which can be inexpensively manufactured (i.e., using affordable standard optical material processing equipment’s and affordability that does not required any special manufacturing process and equipment) in sizes exceeding 200mm. The technology has to offer the versatility of controlling the spectral bandwidth of diffraction for adaptation to specific application needs. Emerging grating technologies such as diffractive wave plates and metamaterials appear promising for the technology objectives. The Navy seeks the inclusion of recent advances in VBG technologies or any new innovation that shall meet the proposed volume of around 4 inch3, and ease of manufacturing that enable fabrication of very high efficiency (> 90%) reflecting gratings with broad linewidth >200nm at 1 to 2µm wavelength. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been be implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an innovative, spectral and angular broadband, high diffraction efficiency grating technology that will support ultrafast lasers for pico second/femto second pulse compressor for > 10 mJ pulses at kHz repetition rate or spectral beam combining MW class high energy laser (HEL). Demonstrate the feasibility of the technology for scaling to large area. Through modeling and simulation, demonstrate the feasibility for combining spectrally broadband laser beams > 200 nm. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include a proposed design that will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop the required technology and incorporate it into a prototype device for high power CW laser Spectral beam combining (SBC) and for ultrafast lasers CPA beam compression technology. Demonstrate that the technology meets the requirements as described. Perform SBC and high power testing for beam combination, and peak power pulse compression to generate GW class of pulse femtosecond laser. Follow on testing will refine the prototype into technology for operational use. Deliver the prototype diffraction grating for the purpose of femtosecond pulse compression or SBC of MW class laser system. Deliver the prototype VBG for -MW class CW HEL SBC and femtosecond laser > 10 mJ per pulse beam compression and evaluation of its power and EO efficiency in a HEL prototype system that can meet Navy performance goals (> 200 nm spectral bandwidth) by the US Navy. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition the Phase II prototype of the high power compact efficient broad linewidth VBG to Navy use for the purpose of HEL technology integration at 1 to 2 um MW class laser. Assist in the integration of the laser system into a submarine or other Navy platform to advance the future Navy warfighting capability.

This includes the introduction of new electronic support (ES), electronic attack (EA), countermeasures (CM), and electro-optic and infrared (EO/IR) systems. Taken collectively, these updates result in a completely new, fully modernized, and greatly expanded Surface Fleet EW capability. However, the increased levels of performance and enhanced mission capabilities being deployed by these hardware improvements are accompanied by an increased burden on the EW operator. The EW operator now has access to more ES information of a greater depth than ever before. As sensor data from radar, EO sensors, and even other ships are fused with the expanded ES data available, the burden on the operator increases exponentially. Operator overload and fatigue are serious problems. While some of this data can be processed automatically by using machine learning or adaptive algorithms, the Navy cannot remove the operator entirely from the loop and the EW operator and display will remain a critical element in surface combat. \r\n\r\nOf particular importance, the EW operator receives a continuous stream of alerts detailing target contacts, system performance, and mission status. Add to these external cues, commands, and situational updates and the volume of alerts can rapidly become unmanageable, especially during highly dynamic operations in dense signal environments. These alerts are important to maintaining successful operations; however, not every alert is of equal importance. Operation during stressing engagements demands that the operator recognize and parse the most important information in real time and in parallel with a large amount of other information presented on the display. While this problem is currently revealing itself in EW operations, the same situation will no doubt present itself in other display consoles as other legacy weapon systems are upgraded and new weapon systems (such as directed energy weapons) are introduced to the Fleet. There are no current commercial applications that can meet this need. \r\n\r\nThe Navy requires an alert messaging management and display technology that ingests, analyzes, prioritizes, organizes, monitors, displays, and tracks alert information presented on the EW operator display. The solution should incorporate a coherent methodology, realized in an architecture of algorithms, and demonstrated on representative displays. Tactical software is not expected from this effort. The solution must be modular and extensible to allow deployment to other display consoles (for example, future directed energy weapons displays) and the solution must be compatible with other elements of the display – for example, processing and display of the alerts must not alter, overwrite, or obscure other elements presented on the display nor should it inhibit other display functions. Since actual tactical displays will not be available, the prototype solution should be demonstrated, tested, and validated on representative display mock-ups. \r\n\r\nThis effort expects the application of the current state of the art in human cognitive science. The solution should be dynamic to adjust to changing situations that demand re-prioritization of alerts. However, clarity of the display is paramount and the operator cannot be expected to search for constantly changing information. The solution should also include an analysis function that prioritizes and organizes alerts in light of current mission requirements and the evolving battlespace. Finally, the solution should monitor, track, and capture the operator response, elevating alerts and enhancing visual cues in order to make sure the most important alerts are addressed and not overlooked. Compatibility with embedded training events during which scripted alerts are injected into the system is required. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

The technology will build a more lethal force and improve fleet readiness. Current available systems use various forms of acoustic tracking beacons which interfere with the acoustic data collection, require very accurate placement of additional hydrophones and do not have the centimeter or inch level of accuracy needed for the small items (UUVs, ROV Divers) used by Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures (EXMCM). \r\n\r\nNavy Expeditionary forces responding to underwater threat objects require an ability to safely deploy and operate Maritime Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (MEMUUV) systems and Maritime Expeditionary System of Systems Response (MESR) Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in a broad range of environments. Navy Expeditionary forces thus require stringent signature measurement and control, which can only be achieved with highly accurate tracking. Once high accuracy tracking is implemented, electromagnetic and acoustic signature reduction techniques can be applied at exactly known sources on the EXMCM EOD equipment. \r\n\r\nAfter measuring first generation USN UUV and ROV signatures using arrays of acoustic sensors at multiple field tests, it became clear that the existing acoustic tracking techniques did not have the tracking range-position spatial resolution required to provide the level of signature fidelity necessary to adequately characterize for minefield suitability purposed, EOD systems for the purposes in which they are employed. \r\n\r\nExisting systems normally involve the attachment of a known high-frequency, high-power, and narrow bandwidth acoustic transponder on the vessel under test, such that through the detections on multiple sensors located on the range, a determination of range can be accomplished. For fairly large USN vessels that create more noise than smaller units, increased stand-off ranges are possible, and errors or variations in range accuracy are much more tolerable. \r\n\r\nA tracking system would help improve the ability to ensure minefield suitability of EXMCM EOD equipment (e.g., UUVs, ROVs, diver-held sensors as well as other equipment operating in mine danger areas [e.g., EOD boats]) and supports USN UUV systems as defined in the Secretary of the Navy Report to Congress on Autonomous Undersea Vehicle Requirements for 2025. \r\n\r\nUUV tracking experience for measurements of <10 yards sensor to source highlighted that acoustic tracking technology achieved marginal accuracy, if at all, and required dynamic positional accuracy for close-in high-fidelity tracking. The goal of this SBIR topic is to design a system to provide accurate, real-time tracking capability in both sea water and fresh water locations. The tracking accuracy threshold is plus or minus 7 inches with an objective of plus or minus 3 inches at a 6-foot Closest Point of Approach (CPA) over a dynamic range of plus or minus 60 feet from CPA. This capability would allow signature reduction prioritization in the developmental stages of EOD equipment production as well as lowering the risk of expensive equipment loss when employed in combat. Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) will test the prototype tracking at an appropriate site to verify 3” accuracy at 6 feet both static (in a tank [e.g., TRANSDEC]) and dynamically in a tank [e.g., CD tow tank]).\r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design a concept for a tracking system that can provide accuracies on the order of inches while tracking an underwater object in real time as detailed in the Description. Demonstrate the feasibility by modeling and simulation as well as technical and engineering design review. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype tracking system and validate it with accuracies suitable for signature measurements within 1-2 yds. NSWCCD will test the prototype in an appropriate tank and document the tracking algorithm and fidelity (improved range accuracy of 3 inches at 6 feet). Demonstrate the system with a full underwater acoustic measurement array. Plan and conduct a requirements analysis session with the Navy technical team to further refine source mounting, feasibility (e.g., determine if anything that’s attached to the unit for tracking affects the performance of the unit, if any additional sensor needed for the system should be added to systems being measured) and UUV interface requirements for a prototype tracking system. Refine the demonstration prototype of an improved tracking system with a designated small or medium-sized Government Furnished Equipment and Information (GFE/GFI) UUV and/or ROV asset. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Work with the Navy personnel and contractor Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to transition the technology to Navy use and gain additional detail on the designated EOD systems that ultimately would be used for integrating the improved tracking system. Support the Navy testing and evaluation team with introduction of the tracking system as a potential ranging capability for UW EOD systems. \r\n\r\nA potential platform for this tracking system is the Underwater Signature Measurement System (USMS), a prototype multi-influence point ranging sensor system developed jointly by the NSWCCD and industry partners, consisting of advanced magnetic, electric, pressure, and acoustic sensors that have been selected and integrated into two qualification units consisting of a cylinder (USMS#1) and a hemisphere (USMS#2). USMS#2 is the proposed unit to be upgraded and made suitable for EOD UUV/ROV vehicle tracking and underwater EM communication. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, several commercial companies produce UUVs and ROVs for U.S. and allied military applications including mine countermeasures, port protection, underwater unexploded ordnance remediation, and naval oceanographic mapping missions. These missions may benefit from the improvements in off hull tracking. \r\n\r\nThe tracking system could also be adapted to small and medium-sized UUVs used for underwater tracking and surveillance tasks by the gas and oil industry, fisheries, scientific research communities, commercial diving and salvage industries; and have a wide applicability in high accuracy tracking applications, even outside of signature applications.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLuo, Junhai, Han, Ying and Fan, Liying. “Underwater Acoustic Target Tracking: A Review.” Sensors (Basel), 2 Jan 2018. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29301318  \r\n\tMabus, Ray. “Report to Congress – Autonomous Undersea Vehicle Requirements for 2025.” https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18Feb16-Report-to-Congress-Autonomous-Undersea-Vehicle-Requirement-for-2025.pdf#viewer.action=download \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Weapons\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop receivers and algorithms that employ Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio signals from existing United States Government (USG) ground stations to determine position and velocity information at sea on a United States Navy (USN) ship or submarine.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The success of U.S. Navy missions depends on personnel and platforms having access to accurate and reliable position, velocity, attitude, and time information. Maritime platforms specifically need this information continuously to support safety of ship, weapons deployment and network communications, and geo-registration. The DoD developed a Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide accurate, worldwide, all-weather, continuous position and time information to warfighters. As a result, GPS is the primary positioning and time source for maritime surface platforms. However, GPS is susceptible to interference and may not be continuously available in a time of conflict. Consequently, backups to GPS are needed for positioning and timing information to meet mission support. \r\n\r\nMany military platforms also deploy inertial navigation systems along with GPS. Inertial navigation systems (INSs) are continuous, all-weather sources of position, velocity, and attitude information. INSs are not susceptible to interference in the same manner as GPS. Also, many maritime platform missions can be met with a military grade INS. INSs drift over time and require periodic fixes to reset their position. Typically, an INS will be corrected by fixes to GPS or some other fix source, such as a visual source, a radar contact or some other navigational feature. In the event of a prolonged period of GPS not being available and no other usual sources being available, additional sources of position fixing are needed. \r\n\r\nUsing VLF signals to aid navigation has its origins from the middle of the 20th century with the OMEGA hyperbolic navigation system being the most widely used system by the U.S. (Russia had a comparable system known as ALPHA.) OMEGA had 8 ground-based transmitters strategically located around the world and provided 24-hour global coverage, operating in the 10-14 kHz range. In these hyperbolic navigation systems, transmitters were synchronized by using one of the transmitters as the trigger for the other to broadcast after a fixed known delay. A receiver measured the signals from the transmitters and a comparison was made between the known delay and the measured delay, and the location of the receiver was determined to lie on a curve that was a function of this delay. Using two or more pairs of transmitters allowed for an accurate horizontal position measurement. \r\n\r\nThe OMEGA navigation system had accuracy in the 1-4 nautical mile (nmi) range, which was dependent on a number of factors. Synchronizing of the two transmitters over transmitter distances of thousands of miles was challenging in the mid-20th century. This error source would later be overcome using atomic clocks at all transmitter sites; however, aligning clocks at multiple sites was still problematic. Additionally, the paths of VLF signals from transmitters to receivers are severely distorted by the ionospheric changes along the very long transmission paths. The OMEGA navigation system ceased transmissions in 1997 with the advent of alternative systems that had greater accuracy, such as GPS. \r\n\r\nHowever, near the end of OMEGA operations, many of the technical challenges limiting VLF navigation’s accuracy performance were solved, including improved ionospheric modeling and better signal processing. \r\n\r\nRecently there has been renewed interest in positioning using VLF signals. A terrestrial-based position and timing source is desired as a backup to GPS, and an OMEGA-like VLF system can provide global coverage with just a few transmitters. VLF signals are very difficult to interfere with because of the high power with which they are transmitted. DARPA’s Spatial, Temporal, and Orientation Information in Contested Environments (STOIC) program sought to achieve GPS-level or better performance in part using VLF signals. The STOIC program demonstrated much improved positioning over OMEGA by creating a stable VLF signal, developing high fidelity physics models of the ionosphere along the signal path and improved signal processing at the receiver. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks innovative technology that can mature the VLF navigation technology to support navigation resilience on U.S. Navy shipboard platforms. The focus of this SBIR topic is expected to center on improved receivers for processing the VLF signals, and algorithms to extract the signals that can be used to develop accurate position and velocity to estimate INS errors without a backchannel communications need for ionospheric corrections. Position fix accuracy should be within 0.5 nmi (dRMS) or better, with fixes available at least 12 hours per day. Short-term velocity output performance should be within 0.1 knots or less (rms, each horizontal axis) over 1 hour. An additional research focus will be on modeling the error characteristics of the VLF-derived position and velocity reference, as this model will need to be incorporated into real-time Kalman filter algorithms of an inertial navigation system. VLF antenna will be a contractor selection, but must not exceed 22” x 22” x 22” in volume. Electronics must fit within a standard 19” electronics rack and not to exceed four electronic rack units (RU). However, receiver and algorithms should be adaptable to both purpose-built and existing VLF shipboard antenna systems. \r\n\r\nThe technology sought will develop the algorithms and receiver technology that will deliver reliable, consistent, and predictable position and velocity information providing known error characteristics. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for improved VLF system navigation algorithms and receivers. Demonstrate feasibility for obtaining accurate position and velocity from maritime platforms using existing Navy or purpose-built antennas. Demonstration will show that the concept meets the requirements as described in the Description and includes analysis, modeling, and simulation. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype of an improved VLF system navigation algorithm(s) and receiver(s). The prototype will show that it achieves the parameters described in the Description. Deliver the prototype to be independently evaluated by the Government to determine if the technology has the potential to meet the Navy’s performance goals for position and velocity accuracy using VLF signals. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Develop a mature prototype capable of testing on a maritime platform. Mature any key algorithms, software or hardware. Field test the system on a maritime platform to demonstrate performance of the mature system. Compare the system’s demonstrated performance with GPS to determine the usefulness and the applicability of this technology in GPS-challenged environments. \r\n\r\nPotential commercial applications include navigation and positioning in mining, aviation, surveying, agriculture, marine, and recreation.

"topic_title": "Nickel-Zinc Submarine Main Storage Battery",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-053",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a Nickel-Zinc (NiZn) battery system that does not rely on Lithium Ion (Li-ion) technology and would replace lead-acid battery system with a more efficient, environmentally safe, maintenance free, and long life battery in the form of a large-format (1,000Ah+) NiZn battery with cycle life and capacity maximized within the design.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The U.S. Navy Submarine Fleet main storage battery currently employs Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) technology to meet platform energy and power requirements. However, with the increasing reliance of electronics on large platforms, future mission needs will require additional battery capacity beyond what current lead-acid battery technology is able to provide. The submarine battery compartment cannot be expanded, so VRLA technologies have seemingly reached operational limits. Therefore, there is a mounting need to transition from the current VRLA battery to an alternative battery technology with a higher energy density and improved reliability. Accordingly, NiZn battery technology has the potential to bridge the energy density gap until Li-ion battery technology can be made reliably safe for submarine applications. Further, submarines continue to see electrical load growth requiring more main storage battery capacity in the same volume. The development of a large-format NiZn battery will offer the needed battery capacity increase on submarines while offering a safer alternative to Li-ion batteries, which, though energy dense, come with a high risk of failure. A Li-ion failure onboard a submarine has the potential to be a catastrophic event. The Navy could potentially delay, or eliminate altogether, a Li-ion transition requirement allowing for lower risk design cycle. \r\n\r\nNiZn is an emerging battery technology optimized for high capacity and long life while also delivering high power in an environmental friendly and safe chemistry. NiZn batteries have a projected increase of about 50% the capacity of lead-acid batteries, with a 25% weight reduction given the same footprint. Currently, prototype and commercial NiZn batteries are of small-format design. Large-format, scaled-up versions of the NiZn designs are not commercially available. Submarine main storage battery replacement will require scale-up of small-format NiZn technology to submarine-specific sized large-format 1,000Ah+ NiZn batteries with cycle life and capacity maximized within the design. The NiZn battery concept must achieve 75% of capacity through 200+ Navy Equivalent Charge/Discharge cycles. Feasibility of concept will be determined through various characterization and operational testing at NSWC Crane. The developed and delivered prototype large-format batteries will be provided to NSWC Crane at the end of Phase II for testing and evaluation. NSWC Crane has the expertise to test and aid development of large-format NiZn batteries using lessons learned from VRLA efforts. The focus of testing at Crane will be to validate the performance of the large-format batteries through characterization and Operational Cycle Life (OCL) testing. OCL will be performed to evaluate the ongoing performance and expected cycle life of the design by pushing the prototypes through various charge and discharge rates over a period of 200+ Navy Equivalent Cycles (NECs). The prototypes will be tested to obtain performance data and demonstrate viability of NiZn as a replacement for Submarine VRLA main storage battery.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a minimum 1,000 amp-hour NiZn battery concept that can achieve 75% of capacity through 200+ Navy Equivalent Charge/Discharge cycles. Develop a design and fabrication approach to scale small-format NiZn to large-format and determine technical feasibility. The initial design concept should include expected cycle life, performance, and manufacturability of large-format NiZn cells and batteries. Feasibility of concept will be determined through various characterization and operational testing at NSWC Crane. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype large-format NiZn cells and batteries based on Phase I work and Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) for demonstration, testing and validation which will include characterization testing to understand the range of capacities through various discharge rates as well as operational testing to validate long-term performance. Prototype will be provided to NSWC Crane at the end of Phase II for testing and evaluation.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Utilize the Phase II prototype testing and analysis results to assist the Navy in transitioning to Navy use. Update design and system development. Integrate Battery Management System (BMS) requirements (furnished by the Navy based on results of testing and evaluation) into final NiZn large-format cells and batteries.. Implement full-scale design manufacturing and transition the end product to the Navy for submarine main storage battery validation, testing, qualification, and certification at NSWC Crane with PMS 392 support. \r\n\r\nThis technology has potential commercial transition to other applications such as aircraft, alternative energy, and data center energy storage. Large-scale NiZn batteries can easily be integrated in current lead-acid applications such as engine start, trucking, and large-scale data centers.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tParker, Joseph F., Chervin, Christopher N., Pala, Irina R., Machler, Meinrad, Burz, Michael F., Long, Jeffrey W. and Rolison, Debra R. “Rechargeable Nickel–3D Zinc Batteries: An Energy-Dense, Safer Alternative to Lithium-ion.” Science, April 2017: Vol. 356, Issue 6336, pp. 415-418. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/415.  \r\n\tChamoun, M., Hertzberg, B., Gupta, T. et al. “Hyper-Dendritic Nanoporous Zinc Foam Anodes.” NPG Asia Mater 7, e178 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1038/am.2015.32 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a high strength composite material that meets U.S. Navy standards for Flame, Smoke and Toxicity Requirements.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Ship building programs throughout the U.S. Navy have begun to increase the use of composite structures throughout the ship, i.e., Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) ramps, LPD 17 mast, and DDG 1000 deckhouse. These composite structures offer lighter weight and better corrosion resistance than a similar metallic part. The composite systems include resin, filler fabric and the methodologies involved in building finished products in various forms with differing functions. \r\n\r\nTo date, identification of composite material solutions have required either relaxation of Flame/Smoke/Toxicity (FST) requirements (outlined in NAVSEA MIL-STD-3020, ASTM E84 and ASTM E662), compromise in material strength (durability) or increase in weight. Fatigue life calculations are based on 270 x 106 cycles, using allowable material properties. The Navy is seeking a new composite material system that provides a more agile forward force maneuverability and posture resilience and all the benefits of using composites while still meeting structural requirements for strength and durability and maintaining Naval fire resistance performance requirements.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a composite system, which will meet FST requirements while allowing for the needed strength and durability characteristics. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and establish that the concept can be developed into a useful product for the Navy. Feasibility will be established by coupon development, laboratory testing and demonstration of the materials. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and test the new system prototype composite system. Test in accordance with NAVSEA MIL-STD-3020MIL-STD-3020, ASTM E84 and ASTM E662 as well as plastic, elastic and failure pull testing to demonstrate strength characteristics.

A Phase III development plan and cost analysis will be prepared to outline transition of the technology to Navy use. Provide detailed drawings, code and specifications in Navy-defined format. In addition, provide support to shepherd the new composite system through the Navy technical approval process.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the new composite system for Navy use on shipbuilding programs beginning with LCAC and SSC Air Cushioned Vehicles. Once a new composite system is validated it is expected to have impact across the full range of composite usage in the Navy.

The commercial state of the art consists of the 5G systems that are under development and will be deployed soon. These 5G systems utilize the lower millimeter-wave frequency low band (e.g., <6 GHz), while the high band (6-24 GHz) region has not yet being considered due to the lower transmission ranges and higher equipment density in a given area for the same coverage. 6G will operate above 24GHz and will have the similar challenges as 5G but on a higher scale. At present significant efforts have been devoted to developing low to mid band millimeter-wave circuit systems. The challenge is to develop a low-cost photonic integration of high speed active optical modulator, high speed photodetectors, and mmWave electronics. The benefit of this approach is to improve performance of the Navy’s optical wireless communication throughput, security, and reliability.\r\n\r\nTo meet the Navy challenges, this topic shall be able to address Spectrum Supremacy as stealth communication for battle space supremacy; the Navy Focus Area for Expand the Advantage through increased capability; and a number of objectives within increased capability to have Navy battlespace supremacy and water-space management.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the transmission range of the standard microwave 5G network, the Navy is interested in an innovative hybrid approach of integrated optical and mm wave transmission. The new System architecture will support future 6G hybrid network systems, that will have significant bandwidth and data-rate improvements (x100-time improvement) over current 5G technology. This demand necessitates significant developments and investigations of different techniques that will enable the required data-rate and bandwidth capacities. Correspondingly, an innovative integrated microwave photonic 6G mm Wave radio transceiver features great advantages to address these issues when compared to traditional microwave/millimeter-wave approaches. Optical fiber enables large operating frequency and bandwidth for 6G networks (operating frequency from 100 GHz to 1000 GHz). However, the field of 6G is still a nascent area. To have 6G hybrid high data rate optical network, the integrated microwave photonic transceiver must overcome the crucial technical challenges in the receiver (RX) modulator’s efficiency by achieving an ultra-low Vpi < 1 volt (where Vpi is the voltage drop needed to cause a 180 degree phase change) and the Transmitter (TX) photodetector’s poor optical-to-mmWave power conversion efficiency. The company and the research institution should use the Open model base engineering environment, open source software such as C++, for the product development and documentation. The goal of this program is to develop hybrid microwave photonic transceiver modules that can operate from 60GHz (5G) up to 200GHz (for future 6G). The transceiver should demonstrate greater than 10 percent fractional bandwidth. For 5G operation, the transceiver should enable a base station to demonstrate >10Gbps up/down link throughputs. For future 6G operation, the transceiver should enable >1Tbps throughputs.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for mmWave wide dynamic range and low noise figure integrated amplified Photonic system based on model-based engineering (MBE) as outlined in the Description. Demonstrate the feasibility of developing a compact size, weight, area, power, and efficiency (SWaPe) mmWave 6G radio transceiver that enables ultra-high efficiency conversion between mmWave and optical signals using integration microwave photonic implementation as discussed in the Description through simulation and identify the primary technical risks of the concept. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description for the ground fault detection and localization system; and develop a test plan and test procedures for the prototype to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop, demonstrate, and deliver a prototype low SWaPe mmWave 6G radio transceiver using integrated microwave photonics. The working prototype must address technical risks, validate the draft specifications, and demonstrate the functionality of the overall design. Develop, demonstrate, and deliver a prototype low SWaPe mmWave 6G radio transceiver using integrated microwave photonics at 60GHz or higher. The transceiver should demonstrate greater than 10 percent fractional bandwidth. The working prototype must address technical risks in developing integrated high speed linear optical modulators and high speed photodetectors, and their integration with millimeter electronics and swap antenna. The working prototype must demonstrate 6G base-station operation with >10Gbps up/down link throughputs. The Phase II work should also demonstrate a clear path for achieving future 6G operation at 200GHz band.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning of the technology to Navy 6G platform mmWave communication link into subsurface and surface platform. Document the design and capabilities of the modulator prototype developed under Phase II. Work with the Government to develop specifications. Provide support by finalizing and validating the compact low Vpi wide dynamic range, low noise figure, optical modulator based on needs of the Navy Electronic Warfare analog fiber optic links. Integrate and test the modulator with high dynamic range fiber optic links. Private Sector Commercial Potential: The development of compact, low Vpi wide dynamic range modulator has commercial potential for telecom applications such as cable TV, radio over fiber, etc.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStrinati, E.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop and integrate a digital solution for naval propulsor repair and new manufacture geometric certification for greater war readiness, performance, and affordability.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The certification of the geometric properties of propulsors are a key factor in meeting many Key Performance Parameters and Key System Attributes for United States Navy (USN) ships. Proper execution of propulsor geometric inspection and certification supports ship powering, signature, and vibration performance requirements. Current practice for USN propulsor certification requires the application of highly maintained sets of physical gages in a controlled and detailed process. The cost and time involved in this process can lead to delays in delivery to ship and degraded ship propulsor performance. The Navy seeks a fast and practical way to inspect and certify new and repaired propulsor assets to create a more resilient and agile logistics path and support on time delivery of ships and submarines. \r\n\r\nUSN propulsors are large, finely machined assets that have unique and complex manufacturing tolerances, both of which present challenges to geometry certification and challenge the current state of the art in digital surface scanning and assessment. Certification of propulsors requires both very tight local surface profile tolerance over a wide area, as well as local and global derived geometric characteristic tolerances unique to propulsors. Current commercially available components lack the required speed and accuracy of data collection, the analytical capability to assess against relevant propulsor tolerances, and the capability to easily direct repair; and they are not integrated systems. Development is required to allow for a 23’ diameter x 5’ deep volume to be captured on a newly machined metallic surface at sufficient accuracy to verify tolerances of 0.005”. Specialized software development is required to process the captured data in a manner consistent with USN propulsor tolerances. Innovation can also be applied to the interpretation of the data analysis and its application in identifying corrective actions and conveying them to the machinist. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to develop an integrated survey, analysis, and reporting system for use in new manufacture and repair of USN propellers. The survey system shall be able to measure a representative NiAlBr propeller of 23’ diameter to a precision of at least 0.00025” in less than 6 hours. The analysis software shall quality control the surveyed data, and analyze it in a fashion consistent with USN guidance on propeller dimensional inspection in near-real time with minimal user involvement. \r\n\r\nThe system will be assessed against a standard inspection of a test monobloc propeller or controllable pitch propeller (CPP) blade and a process review of the analysis method. The system shall document the blade condition and aid the inspector/machinist in identifying dimensional exceedances and coordinating corrective actions.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Propose a concept for an integrated system solution for geometric inspection, evaluation, and result output of monobloc propellers and controllable pitch propeller (CPP) blades. Demonstrate the capability to optically evaluate a representative article to the required accuracy. Provide a concept for blade dimensional analysis and demonstrate ability to produce and develop similar software. Provide and demonstrate a concept for utilizing the analysis data to assist in the remediation of the blade to determine feasibility. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include initial design specifications and description of capabilities to build a prototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build and demonstrate a prototype system of the solution on a USN asset provided by the Government team, i.e., a USN propeller and a controllable pitch propeller (CPP) blade will be arranged in a repair facility along with required reference information. Demonstrate that the prototype can perform all aspects of the inspection process on the provided propeller and CPP blade, including setup, data acquisition, data analysis, and reporting. Assess prototype performance against a standard inspection of the test articles, as well as on the design specifications and capabilities outlined in the Description.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy in transitioning the technology by providing systems (4-20) for procurement by 2SCog Propulsion Program, USN Regional Maintenance Centers or other NAVSEA facilities, and/or industry vendor partners as well as training in their use. The resulting systems should include surveying devices and associated items required for operation, analysis software, and any software or items required for output/utilization of analysis data. \r\n\r\nThese systems will be used to support all Navy surface ship assets, particularly DDG, LPD, CVN, and LCS classes. These systems will allow rapid evaluation of units in the field and in facilities, providing better and faster assessment of required repairs and performance impacts. This would allow for a reduction in repair lead times of roughly 60-360 days, creating a shorter, more flexible logistics chain to support fleet needs. This would also reduce non-recurring engineering (NRE) and capital costs on designing and manufacturing the blade gages required for traditional inspection, 0.5-2M over the next five years, as well as virtually eliminating the $50-200K expense of each inspection leading to more affordability in ship procurement and availabilities. Not including new delivered ships or emergent repairs, the 2SCog program plans to procure at least 46 new or refurbished propellers and blade sets over the next 5 years. This system could also likely be extended to virtually any foil-like high performance part, such as turbines or aviation for both DoD and commercial applications.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAllen, David W., et al. “Propeller Geometric Parameter Extraction From Inspection Data Clouds.” Journal of Ship Production, Vol. 21, No. 4, NOV 2005, pp. 203-208. https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SNAME-JSP-2005-21-4-203  \r\n\tAllen, David W., Harsh, Albert F., and Machin, James D. “Computer-Aided Marine Propeller Inspection Data Analysis.” Naval Engineers Journal, Vol 107, No. 2, MAR 1995, pp. 33-40. https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asne/nej/1995/00000107/00000002/art00010  \r\n\tLi, Feng; Stoddart, David and Zwierzak, Iwona. “A Performance Test for a Fringe Projection Scanner in Various Ambient Light Conditions.” Procedia CIRP - 10th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering, Vol 62, DEC 2017, pp. 400-404. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317047660 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an advanced non-corroding material to use in replacement DDG-51 FLT III Helicopter Flight Deck Tie Downs.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The U.S. Navy’s DDG-51 Class Destroyer helicopter flight deck utilizes tie downs to anchor and secure the helicopters on the flight deck. While the tie downs should ideally last for the 40-year service life of the vessel, in practice they fail due to corrosion and often need replacement. The corrosion of a flight deck tie down is a grave hazard, as its failure at an inopportune time could cause extensive damage to valuable equipment and endanger the lives of the sailors aboard. Anti-corrosion coatings and coverings have not been effective at eliminating the problem. The Navy requires the development of an innovative, noncorroding material to replace the existing flight deck tie down. \r\n\r\nThe development of a noncorroding material to meet the Navy need will require significant innovation to overcome several technical challenges, it must withstand saltwater immersion, exposure to industrial chemicals and jet fuel, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation; and be fire resistant and resistant to galvanic corrosion. Attaching tie downs of a new material class to the deck may require innovative welding techniques or advanced mechanical fastening methodologies. Whatever method is developed, it must be able to meet the same requirements as the current Navy tie down. Required maintenance must be able to be performed by Navy personnel. The joining method must also be watertight to the deck and prevent corrosion below the tie down. \r\n\r\nResearch into noncorroding materials has identified materials that could potentially be developed to meet the Navy’s need. Some of the more promising possibilities include Advanced Thermoplastic Composites, High Strength Metallic Glass, and Novel Metallic Alloys. However, no material within these categories has been adequately demonstrated to be a replacement for the strength and durability provided by steel. Thermoplastic Composites and Metallic Glass would most likely require mechanical joining. Novel Metallic Alloys might be easier to weld to the deck, but care must be taken to prevent galvanic corrosion in the steel. All these materials would need to pass extensive testing to demonstrate that they can replace the existing flight deck tie downs and withstand the repeated heavy loads required to anchor the ships assigned aircraft as defined in NAVSEA Drawing 803-1916300 Rev P (2013), “Hull Standard Drawing Aircraft Securing and Engine Run–Up Fittings”, July 2013. Innovation will be required to reduce acquisition costs and produce a viable product for the Navy.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an innovative noncorroding material for Flight Deck Tie Downs that meets the requirements described above. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs and establish that the concept can be developed into a useful product for the Navy. Feasibility will be established by test of a material sample that will be analyzed in such a way that its failure mechanism will be representative of the larger product supported by finite element analysis. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build and demonstrate a prototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver at least one prototype tie down for evaluation to determine capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW. Product performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation, modeling, analytical methods, and demonstration over the required range of parameters including numerous cycles. Perform an extended test in a maritime environment to refine the prototype(s) into a design that will meet Navy requirements. Prepare a manufacturing and development plan to transition the noncorroding tie down to Navy use. Support the Navy in transition planning and initiation of the Flight Deck Tie Down to Navy use. Develop installation and maintenance manuals for the tie down to support transition to the fleet.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the tie down technology to DDG-51. Potential private sector uses for advanced noncorroding materials include both the automotive and aerospace industries. Other commercial applications include architecture and maritime use.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMavhungu, S.T.; Akinlabi, E.T.; Onitiri, M.A. and Varachia, F.M. “Aluminum Matrix Composites for Industrial Use: Advances and Trends.” Procedia Manufacturing, Volume 7, 2017, pp. 178-182. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978916302086  \r\n\tWu, Fu-Fa; Chan, K.C.[ Jiang, Song-Shan; Chen, Shun-Hua and Wang, Gang. “Bulk Metallic Glass Composite With Good Tensile Ductility, High Strength and Large Elastic Strain Limit.” Scientific Reports 4, Article number: 5302, 2014. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05302 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Cybersecurity\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop solutions that maximize use of automated network configuration management, machine learning (ML), advanced data analytics, Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM), and decision analysis to execute unmanned systems UxS missions in a cyber-contested environment.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy seeks development of software, or a combination of software and hardware, to provide advanced cybersecurity capabilities in accordance with Navy Cybersecurity Technical Authority Standards Naval Systems Command Enclave Process v1.0 (dated 19 Sep 2017) and Defense-in-Depth Functional Implementation Architecture (DFIA) Standard (STD-DFIA-004R0), and the National Institute Standards for Technology Special Publication 800-53 rev 4 to UxS vehicles (e.g., Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle [MDUSV], Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle [MUSV], Large Unmanned Surface Vehicle [LUSV]), as well as support the needs of ships and vessels with reduced crew complements (e.g., FFG(X), Littoral Combat Ship [LCS], Military Sealift Command [MSC] ships). The solution provides an effective platform boundary that enables UxS vehicles to operate in a cyber-contested environment. The contested environment includes denial of services (DOS), man-in-the-middle [MITM], and unauthorized data exfiltration from both internal and external actors. The hardware and software may include technologies such as intrusion protection systems (IPSs), intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and SIEM. \r\n\r\nTo ensure interoperability with PMS 406 portfolio, the solution must comply with the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA), which establishes a standard for common interfaces and software reuse among the mission autonomy and the various vehicle controllers, payloads, and Command and Control (C2) services in the PMS 406 portfolio of UxS vehicles. The UMAA common standard for Interface Control Documents (ICDs) mitigates the risk of vendor lock from proprietary autonomy solutions; effects cross-domain interoperability of UxS vehicles; and allows for open architecture (OA) modularity of autonomy solutions, control systems, C2, and payloads. The Navy will provide the open standards for UMAA upon award of Phase I. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is seeking a broad range of emerging technologies that take advantage of commercial advances in network monitoring and management, SIEM data analytics, and ML to detect cybersecurity anomalies and automatically reconfigure network control points to isolate cyber events and preserve mission critical functions. No current commercial technologies exist that have the military applications that the Navy seeks, without significant tailoring to meet mission specific requirements. \r\n\r\nCommercial solutions for network management, SIEM analysis, and system configuration often presume highly skilled humans in the loop or on the loop to evaluate the overall health of a network and execute (or at minimum, approve) changes to network configurations prior to execution. The Navy is interested in solutions that execute these functions without human intervention or supervision to perform tactical UxS missions. \r\n\r\nIn execution, these solutions would monitor traffic flow across multiple network enclaves within a UxS vehicle, make automated decisions regarding how to reconfigure the network to isolate anomalous behavior, and provide supervisory control of network traffic to enable/prioritize flow of mission-critical data flow while protecting the vehicle from horizontal escalation of anomalous traffic patterns. \r\n\r\nThe small business solution could take advantage of ML to integrate with commercially available SIEM and network configuration technologies. The solution should demonstrate the ability to identify anomalies and automate the process for identifying the appropriate responses needed to isolate the anomalies and implementing the appropriate network changes. Solutions must be effective without human intervention, given a number of pre-approved parameters. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Provide a concept to solve the Navy’s problem and demonstrate the feasibility of that concept. Assess the feasibility by including at least one cyber table top (CTT). Identify the product(s) that comprise the overall solution, which may be either software or a combination of hardware and software based on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) technology solutions and in accordance with the UMAA standards for physical and logical interfaces for ports, protocols, and services. Demonstrate feasibility using techniques such as modeling and simulation or demonstration testing in a commercial laboratory. As an example, propose a demonstration of a ML algorithm that analyzes SIEM data and issues a control to a network management device that changes the configuration of a network host. The Phase I demonstration could include human-in-the-loop supervisory control, provided the company explains how follow-on phases would fully automate the control function. Companies are expected to propose a specific plan for testing concept feasibility as part of their proposals. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver two prototype systems for testing and evaluation based on the statement of work (SOW) and Phase I results. The solution must demonstrate full automation (i.e., no human intervention required) of the process to detect an anomaly, determine the appropriate response, and execute the network configuration changes necessary to isolate the anomaly while still enabling mission-critical traffic flow. \r\n\r\nThe prototype system will vary based on the company’s proposed approach, but it may include hardware and software. The hardware may be a commercial system, a Navy-provided system, or a combination of commercial and Navy-provided systems. The prototype will be evaluated in a Navy lab or at-sea environment. If the prototype is evaluated at sea, it may be evaluated on a manned or unmanned platform as appropriate for the solution. The Navy may opt to choose a surrogate platform for at sea testing based on availability of assets. Additional laboratory testing, modeling, or analytical methods may also be appropriate depending on the company’s proposed approach. The test location will be at the USS Secure. \r\n\r\nThe system will be evaluated on its ability to with stand cyber-attacks (e.g. DOS, MITM) and the exfiltration of information from both internal and external threat actors. The testing and evaluation process will be accomplished through penetration testing. The personnel overseeing the tests will include representation from PMS 406. In general, two prototype articles should be provided to the government for testing, at least three months prior to the end of Phase II. A Phase III development plan will be required at the end of Phase II. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology (i.e., software integrated with Navy-provided hardware, or software integrated with company-provided hardware) to Navy use through system integration, testing support, software and hardware documentation, and limited hardware production if applicable. \r\n\r\nPossible platforms where the technology will be used include the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MUSV), the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV), and the Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MCM USV). \r\n\r\nIn Phase III, the product will be validated, tested, qualified, and certified for Navy use in at-sea trials across a wide range of conditions as applicable for the relevant class of problem. Additional software testing will likely also be required to ensure that all applicable conditions can be tested even if they do not occur during at-sea test periods. \r\n\r\nThese solutions have potential for dual use in unmanned or minimally manned commercial ships or unmanned vehicles that would benefit from the automation of rapid response techniques to isolate.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTidjon, Lionel N.; Frappier, Marc and Mammar, Amel. “Intrusion Detection Systems: A Cross-Domain Overview.” IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 21(4), 2019, pp. 3639-3681. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735821  \r\n\tBringhenti, Daniele; Marchetto, Guido; Sisto, Riccardo; Valenza, Fluvio and Yusupov, Jalplliddin. “Towards a fully automated and optimized network security functions orchestration.” 2019 4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Security (ICCCS).

Current missiles use high temperature metals for control surfaces and ceramics (such as silicon nitride or silica) for radomes. Future advanced missiles will require components with greater thermal shock resistance with properties such as those exhibited by ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). However, the only fibers available for incorporation into CMCs are fused silica (“quartz” fibers), Nextel aluminosilicate fibers from 3M, and Nicalon fibers. These fibers suffer from a limitation on service temperature, generally about 1000-1200°C for the oxide fibers, and 1400°C for silicon carbide fibers. In the past, there has been insufficient market potential to support commercial development of fibers for higher temperature service. \r\n\r\nHigher temperature fibers are desired, with the capability of surviving 1500°C or higher. For radome applications, fibers with low dielectric constant and low loss tangent are needed. The desired values for dielectrtic properties, mechanical properties, and thermal properties depend on specifics of the radar system and overall weapon design, and can vary. There is no absolute limit for either, but the concepts are discussed in the reference by Walton [Ref 5]. Examples of possible compositions for high temperature, low-dielectric constant fibers include boron nitride (BN) and silicon nitride (Si3N4). Both types of fibers were produced experimentally in the 1975-1995 timeframe but are not available commercially. Availability of high temperature fibers possessing the desired combination of properties (such as high elastic modulus, low dielectric constant and loss tangent, and high strength to elevated temperatures) will enable the development of ceramic matrix composites with vastly improved high temperature properties compared to current CMCs. \r\n\r\nMissile components needing these material technology improvements include radomes and control surfaces, since they tend to experience the worst of thermal heat stresses during high-speed flight. As such, the material solutions will need to have electrical properties conducive to radome functionality (e.g., low dielectric constant, low loss tangent) in addition to high thermal stability and high oxidation resistance necessary for both radomes and control surfaces. \r\n\r\nPossible applications for the desired technology include tactical missiles, long range guided projectiles, and hypersonic vehicles.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for high temperature ceramic fiber materials that meets the parameters and applications in the Ddescription. Establish concept feasibility of the requirements through analysis, modeling, and experimentation of materials of interest. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver notional full-scale prototypes that demonstrate functionality under the required service conditions including thermal and mechanical stresses. Use evaluation and testing to include high temperature mechanical tests, thermal shock tests, electrical tests, non-destructive testing, and microstructural examinations to show the prototype will meet Navy performance requirements.

Operator controls for these systems have historically been developed slowly over time in conjunction with advances in the system technology and in response to operational experience, simply adding new features to the existing displays. For example, current radar operator displays and controls evolved from the analog scopes and dials used to measure and adjust analog radar functions. As new radar features were added, displays and controls were added and the operators were trained to absorb, process, and respond to the additional information. The advent of digital and flat panel technologies caused an exponential growth in the amount of information about target detections and extracted target parameters that could be displayed, but the system designer still had a solid foundation of prior art to guide the evolution of the operator interface. This is equally true in commercial applications, for example, air traffic control radars and displays. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, directed energy (DE) weapons are being developed in technological leaps such that the human-machine interface (HMI) can no longer afford this type of deliberate evolution. From the outset, the DE operator will be inundated with tactical information, much of it requiring quick decisions and responses. The potential for operator overload is significant, and the display must be developed in a manner that supports how the operator uses the available information to provide the most efficient and effective display of data, thus reducing the potential for human error in lethal and non-lethal engagements. The commercial world provides few, if any analogies and provides no ready solution that meets the particular combination of demands placed on the naval warfighter during combat – especially in the use of a weapon system that has no non-military counterpart and no historical precedent. Furthermore, evolving threats and the insertion of new capabilities and tactics to meet those threats means that the DE console, and its interaction with the human operator, will not remain static over time. The HMI must accommodate the addition of new capabilities as well as updates to both software and tactics, and provide the flexibility for operators to hone their skills while exploring new operational concepts without the need for extensive re-training. The DE console must therefore incorporate technology that reflects the current state of the art in human cognitive science. \r\n\r\nIn particular, high energy laser (HEL) weapon, are unique in their capability and complexity. HEL systems incorporate elements of both sensors and weapons; are instantaneous; and have essentially unlimited range. Target cueing, de-confliction, atmospheric conditions, sensor coordination, resource management, battle damage assessment, and multiple other operational considerations place unprecedented demands on system operators and on the displays and controls at their command. An integrated HEL operator display is needed that maximizes operator performance while mitigating operator fatigue and the potential for error. \r\n\r\nFrom a hardware aspect, the HEL operator HMI is anticipated to utilize and be based on the existing shipboard combat system display console. This console features three large flat panel LCD color displays with touch screen capabilities available on at least one of the panels. The intent of this effort is not to design a new and dedicated set of console hardware – this would be contrary to the Navy’s goal of commonality and affordability. Neither is the goal of this effort to develop finished tactical code for deployment (validation and certification of tactical code is prohibitively expensive). Rather, the goal of this effort is to design an HMI display that is based on how the user gathers and employs information that complements the particular strengths of human perception and the decision-making processes. It should be noted that “display” in this context is not just a collection of graphical interfaces and data read-outs. The display technology required is a coherent theme of graphical elements, symbology, visual cues, real-time video, and textual data captured in an HMI style guide and demonstrated (with representative software) on surrogate displays. This includes the methodology that organizes and presents these elements in conjunction with operator actions and queries. The technology should optimize the human operator’s effectiveness and efficiency by making the interaction between the HEL weapon system as seamless and natural as possible, and enabling the operator to effectively process and employ the myriad of information available in the most effective means to achieve mission success. Therefore, acceptable solutions must be firmly grounded in the science of human cognition. Testing will consist of controlled and monitored execution of the HMI technology with human operators utilizing the surrogate display hardware. Final validation of the prototype will be demonstration of the HMI prototype on the surrogate display hardware, as witnessed by Government subject matter experts and program managers. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an HEL weapon operator HMI as defined in the Description section. Demonstrate the feasibility of the approach based on the principles of modern human cognitive science and some combination of analysis, modeling, simulation, and evaluation of initial candidate display architectures and themes. Show that the proposed approach can be fully realized and demonstrated on surrogate hardware in Phase II. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and format for the display style guide as well as a capabilities description of the prototype solution that will be delivered in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype of the concept of the HEL weapon operator HMI technology that meets the requirements defined in the Description section. Demonstrate the prototype on surrogate computer hardware and displays (may require the synthesis of surrogate display inputs for example, video imagery). Further demonstrate the prototype through the development of non-tactical code that emulates the tactical displays. Update, finalize, and deliver the design specification that was initiated in Phase I along with the fully demonstrated style guide. Government subject matter experts and program managers will witness demonstration of the prototype technology on the surrogate display system. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. This may include evaluation of the final HMI implementation in tactical code on the tactical displays to validate compliance with the design specification and style guide; and may also include expansion of the style guide as additional data elements are incorporated in the HEL operator display in the future and as the display hardware receives normal updates. \r\n\r\nPotential additional uses of the fundamental display technology developed under this effort include applications to highly complex and networked systems such as air traffic control, train dispatching, control centers for the electrical power grid, and wide-area security systems.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEndsley, Mica R. “Designing for Situation Awareness: An Approach to User-Centered Design, Second Edition.” Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2011. https://www.crcpress.com/Designing-for-Situation-Awareness-An-Approach-to-User-Centered-Design/Endsley/p/book/9781420063554  \r\n\tSt. John, Mark and Smallman, Harvey. “Staying Up to Speed: Four Design Principles for Maintaining and Recovering Situation Awareness.” Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making 2, 1 June 2008, pp.118-139. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1518/155534308X284408 \r\n\r\n",

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an advanced read-out technology that improves the detection of small targets with large, staring, infrared focal plane arrays.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Focal plane arrays (FPAs) are used in narrow field of view (NFOV) sensors (i.e., cameras) to obtain high resolution images and in wide field of view (WFOV) sensors to surveil large areas of interest. In military applications, NFOV sensors typically benefit from powerful optics with high magnification and stabilized gimbal mounts that hold the camera on target and maintain a moving track. In this application, relatively small format FPAs can be used to image individual targets. In contrast, sensors used for persistent surveillance typically stare in a fixed direction to ensure that all possible targets within the field of view are detected. For staring sensors, the only way to increase resolution is to increase the size of the FPA since the magnification of the optics alone can’t be increased without changing the angle of view. For WFOV staring sensors therefore, extremely large FPAs must be used to provide the maximum resolution possible. Not only does this drive up cost (FPA cost typically scales with size), it also introduces other design problems in the imaging system. In particular, large FPAs (with pixel counts in the millions) generate a huge amount of data. Not only is processing this data a challenge, but simply moving the image data off of the FPA to the image processor becomes problematic. This is especially so if the system operates at a high frame rate. \r\n\r\nIn staring sensors, a great deal of the image space does not appreciably change from frame to frame. Empty sky remains empty sky and even clouds, calm water, shoreline, and land features are static when compared to the fast changing features of the image. In typical image file formats, these constant pixels can be compressed, greatly reducing the file size. However, this isn’t done until after the image data is read out from the FPA. Capture and read-out of the FPA image data is done by a dedicated circuit, the read-out integrated circuit (ROIC). The ROIC is tightly coupled to the FPA and it is the ROIC that detects and integrates the signal generated by each pixel in the FPA. Therefore, the ROIC largely determines the signal to noise (S/N) ratio, the optical dynamic range, and the frame rate of the sensor. Image data captured and output by the ROIC can be improved by post processing but the ROIC characteristics place a fundamental upper limit on the detection performance of the sensor system. A fixed dynamic range, uniform across the image plane, inhibits simultaneous detection of both extremely dim and intensely bright objects. \r\n\r\nCommercially available sensors are subject to this constraint, which is why digital photographs often have areas that are “blown out” and other areas are so dark as to record no detail. This is accommodated for by adjusting exposure to exclude dim subject matter by biasing the sensor to preferentially capture the brightest part of the image. High dynamic range image capture compensates for this by taking multiple images. However, compensation is accomplished in post-processing and no acceptable real-time solution is commercially available. Furthermore, a fixed frame rate, also uniform across the image and limited by the ability of the system to ingest the huge volume of data generated, inhibits the ability to detect and track small, fast moving, or rapidly fluctuating objects. In all such cases, it is “small” targets that are the most difficult to detect. Practical considerations limit the read-out of very large format FPAs to low frame rates. Coupled with the limitations of well capacity, this mean that only a small percentage of the light in a given frame can be captured and imaged by a large format FPA. This results in a reduction in signal-to-noise that effectively “hides” low signature targets. \r\n\r\nOptically small targets are not necessarily small in physical dimensions. A large target at great range appears small to the sensor. Such targets may also be unresolvable due to the FPA size and limitations in the imaging optics. In the limit, a detectable target may occupy as little as one pixel. Typically, these targets are also dim as compared to the surrounding image. However, extremely bright small targets cannot be ignored. Motion or fluctuation in intensity of the target further complicates detection. Therefore, multiple, simultaneous, unresolved targets of a few pixels or less, exhibiting large brightness ranges and moving or fluctuating in intensity, present a particular challenge to staring WFOV sensor systems – largely due to limitations in the ROIC. Yet it’s these targets that are most critical for the system to detect, track, and identify. \r\n\r\nA better solution would be to dynamically adjust the read-out of the image to optimize detection performance of the FPA over small, select, “windows” of interest – for example, over a 16 by 16-pixel area. Since targets may be fast moving and/or rapidly fluctuating in intensity, the selected window should track with the target and automatically adjust its size and integration time as the localized intensity, contrast, and target motion and fluctuation demand. Since the application envisions very large format staring FPAs that may contain multiple simultaneous targets of interest in the field of view, multiple independent windows (up to 40) are needed. \r\n\r\nThe Navy needs an innovative FPA read-out technology that automatically identifies and selects regions of interest in the overall image and then interrogates the pixels within that region to define and then dynamically adjust the capture of pixel data within that region for optimum detection. Furthermore, the identified regions of interest should be capable of moving with the target and adjusting in size to maintain the necessary target detection and tracking, thereby minimizing the amount of additional data output from the ROIC. The goal is to increase WFOV sensing in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band without significantly increasing sensor cost. Therefore, the solution should not demand the concurrent invention of a new FPA but should be compatible with at least one of the existing families of MWIR FPA technologies (minimum 1 Megapixel format and maximum 12 micron pitch). Validation of the prototype will be accomplished by testing the combined FPA and readout circuit against moving targets (either targets of opportunity or synthesized targets on an outdoor range). Successful demonstration will include detection and tracking of targets as small as one pixel where the target is so dim as to be at least 3 dB below the FPA’s normal dynamic range.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an innovative FPA read-out technology that improves the detection of multiple small and hard=to-resolve targets as described in the Description section. Define the architecture of the read-out technology and identify and select a compatible FPA technology in the MWIR band (minimum 1 Megapixel format and maximum 12 micron pitch). Demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach including the ability to scale to large format (tens of Megapixel) FPAs and predict the ability of the concept to achieve the simultaneous detection of targets that exceed the read-out circuit’s inherent dynamic range and are undetectable at the read-out circuit’s native frame rate. Demonstrate feasibility by some combination of analysis, modelling, and simulation. Analyze and predict the impact of the technology on the volume of image data produced by the read-out circuit. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include a device specification, initial process description, and test plan in preparation for device prototype development and demonstration in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and deliver a prototype FPA read-out technology as detailed in the Description section. Demonstrate that the technology meets the requirements in the Description section. Demonstrate the technology by selection of and integration with a suitable MWIR FPA (minimum 1 Megapixel format and maximum 12 micron pitch). Additionally, demonstrate the combined FPA and read-out circuit by imaging scenes of suitable complexity that contain combinations of small, dim, bright, moving, and fluctuating (in intensity) targets. After performance testing, deliver two prototype sensors (read-out circuit, FPA, and supporting circuitry) as well as any custom software, specialized test equipment, calibration equipment, fixtures, and targets developed under this effort to the Naval Research Laboratory.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Government use. Assist in scaling and applying the design for specific sensor systems. Mature, ruggedize, and validate the prototype designs for application to Navy imaging systems and assist in the transition of the technology to those systems. The technology resulting from this effort will have application in the field of scientific imaging as well as in commercial products for security systems, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDriggers, Ronald G., Friedman, Melvin H., and Nichols, Jonathan M. “Introduction to Infrared and Electro-Optical Systems, Second Edition.” Boston: Artech House, 2012. https://us.artechhouse.com/Introduction-to-Infrared-and-Electro-Optical-Systems-Second-Edition-P1536.aspx  \r\n\tMarcotte, Frederick, et al. “High-dynamic range imaging using FAST-IR imagery.” Proc.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a wireless nondestructive testing (NDT) capability to inspect hull metal surfaces and assess hull-to-polymer bond health under thick polymer layers without polymer removal.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: There is currently no method for nondestructive testing (NDT) of metal health through thick polymers. Current methods for inspections through thick polymers involve destructive removal of sections of the thick polymer. Removal and replacement of these polymer sections involve costly (in labor, time, and materials) operations that generate hazardous waste. An electromagnetic imaging NDT method for inspections through thick polymers is needed to reduce lifecycle costs, improve accuracy of initial maintenance work scoping, and increase operational readiness by reducing emergent maintenance issues in-field that were not discovered during scheduled maintenance. Any solution designed herein must wirelessly transmit data from the electromagnetic imaging sensor unit to a remote device for user-analysis. The electromagnetic imaging sensor unit must weigh 15 pounds or less (including power supply). \r\n\r\nThe developed NDT system must conform with all Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and deliver a signal-to-noise dynamic range that corresponds to a linear interpolation as a function of frequency between 80dB at 15 GHz and 100 dB at 25 GHz (the frequency range of interest) via either a single frequency, narrowband, broadband, or multi-band solution. The NDT system must detect and classify debonds of any separation distance, corrosion, water intrusion, and surface metal loss (due to damage) of 0.41” diameter or greater on a metal substrate through a thick polymer coating with a refractive index of 1.0. \r\n\r\nNDT of a metal substrate through a thick polymer coating while maintaining sub-wavelength resolution has been a long-standing challenge for electromagnetic imaging technologies, such as Terahertz imaging or millimeter-wave imaging, operating at far-field distances from the signal source. At 15 GHz with n = 1.0, the diffraction limit (wavelength size) is 0.79”, and at 25 GHz with n = 1.0, the diffraction limit is 0.47”. Thus, for the designated frequency band of interest, the given 0.4125” at n = 1.0 feature detection requirement requires sub-wavelength resolution, far-field interrogation of the target. Far-field detection of features smaller than 0.4125” at n = 1.0 is also of interest if possible. Sub-wavelength resolution is possible with geometric super-resolution techniques, such as Multi-spectral Signal Characterization (MUSIC). Far-field super-resolution techniques exist, yet no ruggedized end-user solutions with suitable detector/classifier algorithms are available in the current market. The development of a commercially viable prototype is needed for Navy applications. \r\n\r\nCurrent and near-future Navy preservation applications require fine-resolution detection and classification of metal substrate flaws through thick polymer preservation coatings to perform needed inspections for specific flaws of interest at reduced maintenance cost to the Navy due to repair labor and material from destructive inspection practices. As materials become thicker, they become more attenuating for electromagnetic waves. The materials of interest also become more attenuating with increasing frequency. Thus, to perform needed NDT imaging through the materials of interest, an electromagnetic imaging source is needed that operates along a linear trendline between 15 GHz at 80dB of dynamic range and 25 GHz at 100dB of dynamic range (i.e., 20 GHz at 90dB of dynamic range fits along that linear trendline). Solutions that use performance extrapolations outside of the 15-25 GHz range (along the same dynamic range trendline) are also of interest as long as they meet the required 0.41” minimum flaw detection size, are able to detect “kissing” debonds (defined as when two bonded surfaces break their bond but are still touching), and are in accordance with all FCC regulations. \r\n\r\nAny prototype solution developed will also include commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software tools that provide automated detection and classification of any flaws in the collected data as well as software tools to enable the Navy to incorporate Navy-developed automated detection and classification algorithms. These flaws include debonds (“kissing” and larger debonds), substrate metal corrosion, and water abscessed at the preservation-to-metal interface. The prototype solution should scan for flaws and give processed results as expeditiously as possible. The preferred solution provides results as close to real time as possible, is portable (1-person carry) with supporting equipment, and provides a graphical user interface that is easy to use and understand by a technician with sufficient training. Such training will be developed as part of this topic. The software may be developed in any modern programming language (i.e. Python, R, Rust, Julia, or an appropriate Javascript derivative) and should provide tools for the user to develop and include their own detection/classification algorithms to process the data in real time. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept for a far-field electromagnetic imaging system with the capacity to meet the operational, frequency, dynamic range, minimum detectible flaw size, and automated detector/classifier requirements specified in the Description. Perform modeling and simulation to provide the initial assessment of concept performance and feasibility. Phase I Option, if exercised, would include the initial layout and capabilities description to build the unit in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype based on the Phase I work and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) for demonstration and validation through a field test on a specified, Navy-developed test panel that is equivalent to testing on an in-service Navy asset under field conditions, showing that the prototype meets the performance requirements in the Description. Refine the prototype as required based on the results of the demonstration and validation process. Deliver the final prototype at the end of the Phase II, ready for field use by the Government. Deliver comprehensive instructions and documentation for prototype setup, operation, maintenance, and software SDK development to enable a user to make full use of the prototype. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this Phase II effort will be classified (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy in integrating the Phase II prototype into a field-use technology for Navy technicians. Provide a formal training curriculum (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) for Navy NDT inspectors to become certified in using this prototype for formal Navy NDT inspections. Update the training based on end-user feedback to the first version of the curriculum. Support Navy personnel to ensure all required software is approved for end-user use as well as testing, validating, certifying, and qualifying the prototype for Navy use. \r\n\r\nDual Use applications include other challenging electromagnetic imaging applications, such as assessing rebar health through concrete in structures, through-wall imaging, and contactless suspected bomb inspection.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations.” Federal Communications Commission Office of Engineering and Technology, 07 May 2019 (revision). https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf  \r\n\t“Radio Frequency Safety.” Federal Communications Commission Electromagnetic Compatibility Division, 29 March 2013 (revision). https://www.fcc.gov/general/radio-frequency-safety-0  \r\n\tLiao, Wenjing. “MUSIC for Multidimensional Spectral Estimation: Stability and Super-Resolution.” IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 63, No. 23, Dec. 1, 2015. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7174562  \r\n\tGhasr, M.T.; Ying, M.P. and Zoughi, R. “Wideband Millimeter Wave Interferometer for High-Resolution 3D SAR Imaging.” IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Proc., May 11-14, 2015. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7137253/proceeding \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a highly efficient, direct-to-green laser source for detection of mine and mine-like objects in the Surfzone (SZ) and Very Shallow Water (VSW) regions, Increase the laser efficiency by more than 100% as compared to methods used today.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Current laser sources are very inefficient due to the requirement to obtain the “Green” light from splitting an “Infrared” light source. The generation of green laser light via frequency doubling has typical conversion efficiencies that are ~50% for the process. In addition, the heat dissipation usually requires a method for dissipating the excess energy from the conversion process, upwards of 90%. Research into a relatively new technique of nano-particle doping of fiber lasers shows improved efficiency and power output over current fiber lasers and should be considered when proposing a solution. \r\n\r\nIn Stride Detect to Engage UAVs requires highly efficient laser sources to meet challenging size, weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements. A direct-to-green source would enable higher power at the same or less SWaP, enabling improved Area Search Rates and Time on Station. For the purposes of estimating SWaP requirements in proposals, the targeted air vehicle is similar to a Bell 407. The laser source will be enclosed in a to-be-designed externally mounted pod with an external diameter of 21 inches and external length of 110 inches. The SWaP will be shared with other sensors. The SWaP potentially available for the laser is 0.75 cubic feet, 60 pounds, and 700 Watts at 28 Volts Direct Current. However, it should be noted that one of the goals of the SBIR is to minimize SWaP. Desired output energy is approximately 500 millijoules at 532 nanometers. Trades will be considered between output energy and SWaP. \r\n\r\nThe laser shall take into consideration American National Standard Institute (ANSI) Z136.1, Safe Use of Lasers, and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 1040, Performance Standards for Light-Emitting Products. Other laser requirements, such as pulse width and repetition rate, are based on the chosen receiver. At this time, the Government does not have a receiver in mind but the laser should function with either a 2D Gated or a 3D receiver. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept and determine the feasibility of the concept to design a “direct-to-green” laser with improved efficiency over current “green” lasers. Demonstrate the feasibility of methods to manufacture “direct-to-green” lasers, which are manufacturable and able to be amplified in a highly efficient manner. Initial prototype validation of concept will be encouraged. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), the company shall develop and deliver a minimum Technology Readiness Level 5 prototype “direct-to-green” laser source suitable for follow-on Government testing (to include flight testing) and validation. The Government may test the laser in accordance with MIL-STD-810 test methods for low pressure (altitude), high temperature, low temperature, acceleration, and vibration for an airborne rotary wing environment. Additional tests may use MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-464 to verify electromagnetic compatibility. \r\n\r\nPerform laboratory testing and fully characterize the system prototype. Parameters to characterize include bandwidth, pulse width, repetition rate, beam quality, output pulse energy, and output pulse intensity divergence and uniformity. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The final product should be a ruggedized prototype direct-to-green sensor and software package that can interface with the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Sensor.

Some sensors are placed using cranes and winches from surface ships. Precise placement of the sensors at deeper depths requires sophisticated station keeping and tracking capabilities, and typically results in moderate to high deployment costs. Surface ship deployment of deep sensors using cranes and winches have costs that scale with platform size and mission duration. Costs can range from $0.5M to $10M depending on the sensor payload size and mission details. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or deep submergence vehicles (DSVs) are also used to assist in sensor placement. These approaches typically require support from specialized surface ships and thus result in moderate to high deployment costs. Costs for ROV- and DSV-supported placement of deep water sensors typically range from $2-3M to $10-20M. Some sensors are deployed as a payload on an underwater vehicle. Example of vehicles used include underwater gliders, buoys, and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Underwater gliders are typically a low-cost combined sensor-vehicle approach using relatively simple vehicles and components and one- to two-person deployment operations that can be carried out from most any surface vessel. Sensor deployment as part of an underwater glider can result in costs as low as $100K. However, most underwater gliders have limited payload capacity. UUVs vary greatly in size and also in payload capacity. UUVs have excellent payload delivery potential. However, most UUVs, especially those that can operate at deeper depths, have moderate to high purchase and operation costs. Deep-water sensor deployment via UUV typically incurs costs of $500K to $3M, depending on mission details. Floats offer a balance of low cost and moderate payload capacity, with costs ranging from $100K to $300K for some common systems. However, most float systems lack sufficient maneuverability to act as deeper depth sensor deployment systems. \r\n\r\nAt present, most existing methods for deployment of underwater sensors suffer from either high costs, low payload capacity, minimal maneuverability, or restrictions to shallow depths. Low-cost deep capable alternatives are needed. \r\n\r\nThe intent of this SBIR topic is to solicit novel ideas for low cost payload deployment in various depths of water. A system cost less than $200K and deployment costs less than $300K per deep water mission would greatly enable and extend deep water sensor-based activities in oceanographic, biologic, and environmental data collection. All concepts that can provide a low-cost means of deploying common sensor packages are of value and shall be considered. The following metrics are provided as general guidance, but solution concepts can deviate from these metrics as long as the solution provides an advancement in deployment operations or reduction in cost of established or future underwater sensors systems. \r\n\r\nPotential payloads vary greatly in size, shape and weight. A target payload size is provided for purposes of design studies. Concepts that meet or exceed the target payload size will have strong potential for selection and transition. The target payload size is a dry weight of up to 100 lbs (45 kg), a net buoyancy ranging from 0 to 50 lbs (23 kg) negatively buoyant, and a total volume of up to 1000 cubic inches (16400 cubic cm). Although many sensor payloads are currently of cylindrical form factors, solution concepts should have moderate flexibility to accommodate both variations in payload shape and net buoyancy over the ranges provided. \r\n\r\nThe delivery solution shall be easily transported and stowed, ideally with minimal storage footprint and special equipment required. An on-deck footprint of roughly 3ft (1m) by 6ft (2m) would greatly expand surface ship deployment options and thus provide deployment cost reduction potential. Deployment of the delivery solution and payload will ideally require minimal support equipment. It is anticipated that two-person portable and deployable solutions will likely provide the greatest cost savings and have the greatest potential for transition to military and commercial use. Recovery of the delivery solution shall also be considered in comparing solution concepts. The recovery approach should minimize personnel and resources required. It is conceivable that some delivery solutions may be of sufficiently low cost and have a negligible environmental impact such that recovery of the delivery system is not required. Such solutions will have a favorable impact on logistics and will be rated accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe required placement performance of the delivery solution varies with different sensor payloads, but a placement uncertainty of 33ft (10m) is considered to have good transition potential. Placement at a fixed bottom location is considered a primary evaluation criterion. However, the ability to traverse a specified trajectory is also considered a valuable capability and will be considered when evaluating solution concepts. \r\n\r\nIt is desirable for the delivery solution to be able to operate in various depths of water. Depth capability will be a key factor for transition. Concepts should maximize depth capability. Concepts that can operate to full ocean depth will be applicable to the largest range of sensor deployment operations and will thus maximize transition potential. \r\n\r\nUnder many conditions, it can be advantageous to deliver a sensor payload to locations away from the deploying vessel in order to maximize sensor coverage while minimizing distance traveled by the deploying vessel. A delivery approach that can achieve accurate placement of a sensor over an operationally relevant horizontal distance from the deploying vessel has greater transition potential than a solution that can only deliver a payload to a location directly below the deploying vessel. Simple delivery concepts can be conceived which could provide horizontal standoff (range) from the deploying vessel. Concepts that can provide operationally relevant range (1km or greater) will have strong transition potential. \r\n\r\nCost is expected to be the most critical factor affecting transition. As discussed above, significantly reducing the operational costs of current delivery approaches will result in meaningful reductions in the cost of underwater sensor delivery, and therefore any innovation with cost reduction potential is valuable. Solutions that can achieve low system costs, while providing the performance attributes above, will have significant transition potential. Cost savings potential are on the order of $0.5 to $3M+ per payload deployment and placement. \r\n\r\nPhase II will feature prototype development and testing. The Navy will assist in developing a test plan that demonstrates and establishes the full range of performance characteristics of the solution. Potential test sites include the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), or an open ocean test site. Testing depths, environmental conditions, and test payloads shall be selected to fully exercise solutions in order to maximize demonstration value and enhance transition potential. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a conceptual design for a low cost deep-water delivery system that consists of the design, identified critical components, estimates of solution materials and manufacturing costs, and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs for transport, stowage, and deployment. Combinations of analysis, modeling and simulation may be required to establish solution feasibility. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a full-scale prototype system in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype system and validate it with respect to the topic’s objective. The prototype system shall consist of a vehicle functional and system diagram, a complete technical design package, vehicle integration plan, vehicle assembly plan, and vehicle test and evaluation plan that shows how to validate the prototype system performance. Evaluate the prototype based on payload capacity, delivery accuracy to a fixed bottom location for select depths and ranges, delivery accuracy along a desired trajectory for select depths, total system cost, and overall projected costs of transport, launch, and recovery. Aspects of Phase II testing will be dependent on the scope of solutions provided in Phase I. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use in the form of follow-on prototypes, using any lessons learned from the Phase II to improve the solution. Tailor the solution for deployment from specific vessels as required. Additionally, there is extensive commercialization potential for low cost deep-water delivery systems to support deep sea oil and mineral extraction as well as enable the sensors needed to regulate such industries. As such, Phase III will enhance the technologies to maximize alignment for delivery of sensors to support oceanographic, environmental, and biologic data collection, as well as resource management.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWynn, R.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human Systems\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an adaptive narrowband trainer that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and real-world elemental playback data to detect, analyze, and classify real-world Passive Narrowband (PNB) signatures of submarine contacts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: As adversary submarine forces field platforms that are increasingly capable and stealthy, the ability to detect these ships becomes ever more challenging. The ability to pace the threat with newer sensors and processing systems is part of the solution, but sonar sensor operators require better tools to effectively exploit the new sensor and system capabilities, specifically regarding narrowband detection and analysis. Relatively few training products address narrowband detection and analysis. Those narrowband training products that exist fail to leverage adaptive training, and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). Existing interfaces to the latest tactical systems are limited, and existing narrowband trainers are not equipped for updates to represent emerging narrowband phenomena. \r\n\r\nSailor evaluation of PNB signals is particularly critical in successful Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) prosecutions. Depending on the sensor suite available, passive narrowband signals to be analyzed can be hidden across hundreds of beams of bearing and hundreds of frequency bins per line of bearing. Identifying specific signals associated with undersea threats in a timely manner is both a difficult skill to acquire and a skill that is highly perishable when use or effective training is not constant. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks an innovative narrowband trainer that adapts to emerging threats and maximizes accelerated learning. Essential elements of the trainer include a training or gaming platform that is both engaging and instructive. The trainer would ideally be accessed through the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) resident on the respective shipboard tactical system, and capture operator performance data by leveraging experience API (xAPI) and the learning record store (LRS) resident on the tactical system. The trainer may also be accessed by ashore trainers such as the Submarine Multi-mission Team Trainer (SMMTT), the Multifunctional Instructional Trainer (MIT), the Applied Classroom (ACR) or the Virtual Operational Team Trainer (VOTT). \r\n\r\nThe trainer should be designed to include updateable real world elemental acoustic data provided by the Navy as a stimulus for the tactical displays the operator observes. The trainer should employ adaptive training techniques that will progress the student depending upon his/her level of knowledge and level of performance. In cases where the student is more proficient, that student should progress faster through the scenario and not be required to complete tasks associated with lower levels of knowledge or proficiency. The trainer should employ AI/ML to increase the challenge to the student according to the student’s capabilities and to facilitate a rapid learning curve. The trainer should provide feedback to the student, both in the form of dynamic hinting during the scenario and a post exercise evaluation or after action report that is referenced to an approved performance standard for better objectivity. The trainer should represent all display surfaces for data analysis and be able to represent the state of automation present in the build of sonar analysis software the sailor is tasked to use. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the new training capability should leverage best practices in adaptive training. According to Metzler-Baddeley [Ref 2], “adaptive training used study time more efficiently than the chosen control conditions that is participants did not waste time studying items they already knew and were able to concentrate on items that required more training.” In turn, the trainer would maximize the operator’s time and increase training efficiency. According to Forsyth et. al [Ref 3], “adaptive learning recognizes the pace of student learning varies and provides instructors with the tools needed to relieve the time pressure of increased enrollment to reach students where they are in the learning process to enhance both student and teacher effectiveness.” Applying new adaptive learning approaches would benefit not only sonar operators at sea, but would also provide the schoolhouses with an additional resource for classrooms ashore. In addition, Sailor 2025’s Ready Relevant Learning initiative focuses on developing a “learning continuum where training is delivered by modern methods to enable faster learning and better knowledge retention at multiple points throughout a career.” Adaptive training would provide an excellent modern solution to this problem. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic addresses CNO’s desire to achieve “high velocity learning at every level” and supports Sailor 2025. This topic would seek to apply the best concepts, techniques and technologies to accelerate learning for individuals, teams, and organizations. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this topic addresses current training requirements identified in the most recent Submarine Tactical Requirements Group Advanced Development Prioritized Focus Area letter specifically requesting “embedded training systems should be adaptive to the skill level of the trainee and …real world elemental data should be capable of playback…allows for continuous learning on and off watch”. \r\n\r\nFinally, this topic addresses current training requirements identified in the most recent AN/SQQ89 Advanced Capability Build Prioritized Focus Areas letter, to wit: “System training for operators should be readily available and delivered using modern training techniques and adaptive system training…” \r\n\r\nSailor evaluation of passive narrowband signals is particularly critical in successful ASW prosecutions. \r\n\r\nInitial testing of this trainer can be accomplished at the company site given the prerequisite to provide a representative simulation of narrowband acoustic information that would be resident on a tactical system, tactical trainer or virtualized training simulator. Final testing and certification would be accomplished at the prime system integrator site or a site that contains a representative tactical system simulator with an installed Moodle Learning Management System. Initial testing would be conducted by the developer with Government/Government-designated representatives. Final testing and certification would be conducted by Government/Government-designated representatives in concert with Naval surface and submarine force active duty sonar operators. \r\n\r\nMetrics used to assess the learning training capability will refer to learning gain, successful assessment of the adaptive training algorithm, and an acceptable usability score using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model will be used to objectively measure the effectiveness of training. The learning narrowband trainer must be able to integrate into the Moodle LMS as well as the learning record store (LRS) present in the learning architecture embedded in the tactical system of submarines and surface ships. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an adaptive narrowband trainer utilizing AI/ML to teach and reinforce passive narrowband signature recognition. Demonstrate the concept feasibly meets all the parameters detailed in the Description through modeling and analysis. Also, demonstrate the concept can operate in the Moodle LMS, experience API (xAPI), and the LRS discussed in the Description. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype adaptive narrowband trainer for testing by ASW personnel in the Fleet. Demonstrate prototype performance through the required range of parameters in the Description. The Government or the company will provide facilities for testing and validating the prototype. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use through system integration and qualification testing for the adaptive narrowband trainer prototype. Assist in transition and integration of the prototype to a future Advanced Processing Build (APB) Combat System with the potential integration including the Advanced Capabilities Build (ACB). \r\n\r\nThe narrowband training capability can be adapted to other technical fields that involve operator assessment of faint signals, found in electronic communications, medical diagnostic tools, and other engineering disciplines that deal with oscillating signals. Adaptive learning and AI/ML are innovative approaches that would be useful to the wider education and business communities as a whole.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tForsyth, B., Kimble, C., Birch, J., Deel, G. and Brauer, T. “Maximizing the Adaptive Learning Technology Experience.” Journal of Higher Education Theory & Practice, 16(4), 2016, pp. 80-88. https://articlegateway.com/index.php/JHETP/article/view/1992/1892  \r\n\tMetzler-Baddeley, C. and Baddeley, R.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a coupled control system for optimal manipulator operation onboard an expeditionary class underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for greater performance.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The United States Navy’s Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response program seeks to improve the capabilities of expeditionary Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which currently have limited manipulation capabilities. One of the improvements that is being implemented is the integration of multi-degree of freedom manipulator and end effector payloads that will enable these ROVs to perform increasingly complex tasks in the marine environment. ROVs currently in use operate with vehicle control systems that are independent from their payloads. During most operations using this paradigm, the ROV is able to adequately maintain its pose while the manipulator conducts its intervention tasks, operating with its own fully independent control system. For many tasks, an operator at a topside control station must intervene to alter the ROV orientation, communicating with a second operator of the manipulator/end-effector payload(s) who uses a second control station for operation of the manipulator. Work conducted under this topic will develop a fully integrated and coupled single control system for the combined ROV-manipulator system enabling the ROVs thrusters to provide additional degrees of freedom to the manipulator end effector. This approach will enable more fully optimized manipulation and reduce operator workload while performing complex manipulation tasks, and it will reduce the size and complexity of the ROV-manipulator system’s control station as the ROV and manipulator will no longer require separate control interfaces. \r\n\r\nA coupled control system will improve ROV and manipulator/end-effector payload system effectiveness and efficiency in performing complex underwater tasks, while concurrently reducing the size and complexity of legacy topside control stations, the requisite skill level and the quantity of system operators required for task accomplishment. Introduction of improved automation and coupled control of ROVs and payload control will reduce operator burden, training, and life cycle control costs for sustaining operational readiness of Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response (MESR) systems. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate currently fielded systems as well as future developments, platform agnostic control systems architectures will be strongly preferred. Initial ROV platforms for demonstration and feasibility study should include either the VideoRay Defender or SRS Fusion vehicles that are currently in use with Expeditionary EOD units. \r\n\r\nInitial feasibility studies and demonstrations may take advantage of open source simulation environments such as Open Source Robotic Foundation’s Gazebo [Ref 3] or other suitable models that have sufficient fidelity to test and evaluate proposed solutions. \r\n\r\nAfter a candidate coupled control system prototype is developed, it will be used to conduct a series of tasks that would currently be conducted with independent control systems. The differences between the current method and the prototype coupled control system will be quantified and recorded. Particular areas of interest to be explored during this experiment will be total system energy consumption, operator experience, manipulator function, and any other notable changes in capabilities and limitations of the system. This experiment will be conducted in an operationally relevant environment. Access to an operationally relevant environment for the experiment can be provided by the Navy, or the experiment may be conducted at a suitable location chosen by the selected company. \r\n\r\nThe control system developed under this program must employ a cybersecurity-compatible open architecture design to facilitate modular application to ROV platforms and manipulator payloads other than those for which it is specifically developed during this effort. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a proposed control system concept and perform a feasibility study of that proposed concept Feasibility will be assessed based on analytical results of the study. \r\n\r\nOpen source robotics simulation environments are acceptable for evaluating feasibility as are proprietary, custom, or in-house simulations, provided their underlying assumptions and constraints are sufficiently documented. For simulation-based experiments, the ROV and the manipulator system that is modeled should be representative of current Expeditionary ROVs and commercially available manipulator systems to the maximum extent possible. In areas where the model diverges from current systems, the necessary modifications to more closely align with fielded systems should be documented. At minimum, simulated models should demonstrate the fundamental concepts of the coupled control system well enough to evaluate their potential application to Navy ROVs outfitted with multiple-degree of freedom manipulator/end-effector systems. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), the company will develop a prototype of the coupled control system to be integrated onto an ROV-manipulator system that is representative of expeditionary class ROVs the Navy utilizes. Evaluate improvements against current systems through the conduct of a series of manipulation tasks in an operationally relevant ocean environment using both the coupled control system and the independent ROV and manipulator control systems. Quantify energy consumption requirements and characterize capabilities and limitations of path planning, operator experience, and overall manipulation functionalities of the proposed coupled control system in an operationally relevant environment. The Navy will provide access to operationally relevant environments for testing and demonstration if requested. Alternatively, selected companies may conduct tests and demonstrations in environments of their choice provided those environments maintain sufficient fidelity to fully evaluate candidate solutions. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Ensure that the final product to be transitioned to the Navy will be a coupled control system for a Navy expeditionary class ROV with integrated manipulators; and will be designed and fabricated with a cyber-security compatible open systems architecture that will enable modular application to systems other than the prototype hardware/software on which it was originally developed, tuned, and demonstrated. Validate the system by carrying out a series of manipulation tasks relevant to Navy operations. \r\n\r\nCoupled control for ROV/manipulator systems must demonstrate the potential to reduce operator workload and complexity of topside workstations, improve system energy efficiency, and improve the range of manipulation tasks that can be accomplished. Remote underwater manipulation is widely applicable beyond solely Navy applications, particularly in oil and gas, scientific, and academic communities.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSatja Sivcev, et. al. “Underwater Manipulators: A Review.” Ocean Engineering, Volume 163, 1 September 2018, pp. 431-450. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801818310308  \r\n\tBarbalata, Corina; Dunnigan, Matthew W. and Petillot, Yvan. “Coupled and Decoupled Force/Motion Controllers for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System.” Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2018. https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/6/3/96  \r\n\tOpen Source Robotic Foundation’s Gazebo–: http://gazebosim.org \r\n\r\n",

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop atomic inertial sensors that advance the state of the art in inertial navigation.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The success of U.S. Navy missions depends on personnel and platforms having access to accurate and reliable position, velocity, attitude, and time information. Maritime platforms specifically need this information continuously to support safety of ship, weapons deployment, and network communications and geo-registration. The DoD developed Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide accurate, worldwide, all-weather, continuous position and time information to warfighters. As a result, GPS is the primary positioning and time source for maritime surface platforms. However, GPS is susceptible to interference and may not be continuously available. Consequently, in the absence of GPS, other technology is sought to provide positioning and timing information to meet mission support. \r\n\r\nMany military platforms also usually deploy inertial navigation systems along with GPS. Inertial navigation systems are continuous, all-weather sources of position, velocity, and attitude information. Inertial navigation systems are not susceptible to interference in the same manner as is GPS. In addition, many maritime platform missions can be met with a military grade inertial navigation system. Inertial systems drift over and require periodic fixes to reset their position. Typically, an inertial navigation system will be corrected by fixes to GPS or some other fix source, such as a visual source, a radar contact, or some other navigational feature. In the event of a prolonged period of GPS not being available and no other usual sources being available, additional sources of position fixing are needed. \r\n\r\nInertial measurement sensors based on atomic interferometry solve the problem of sensor drift by providing measurements of acceleration and rotation with very low bias instability and random walk. This high performance is essential for GPS-denied inertial navigation, because position errors grow quadratically in time, proportional to random walk in the inertial sensors. Atomic interferometry uses wave-particle duality to measure accelerations and rotations as interference effects. These methods are precise because atoms have an exact internal electronic structure, which can be manipulated by electromagnetic radiation. The typical atomic interferometer is conceptually similar to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, but with laser pulse induced Rabi oscillations enacting the behavior of beam splitters and mirrors. In laboratory settings, atomic interferometers have demonstrated super strategic-grade performance with long-term stabilities in the nano-g accelerometers and nano-radian/sec gyroscopes. \r\n\r\nAtomic interferometers have previously been deployed on ships and airplanes with µg and µrad/s sensitivity, but in general there are a few hurdles to deploying this technology in defense operations. This technology currently exists in the commercial market in the form of scalar quantum gravimeters (single-axis/1DOF accelerometers), but for the most part the technology has been funded and developed only for defense applications. In addition, navigation requires inertial measurement at frequencies well above 100 Hz, but atomic interferometer sensitivity decreases at higher frequencies, since atoms spend less time experiencing the acceleration or rotation. These devices must also have size, weight, and power, and cost (SWaP-C) low enough to be combined into a full inertial measurement unit (IMU) with gyroscopes and accelerometers along 3 spatial axes (for a total of 6 degrees of freedom). Other problems include the 2p-phase ambiguity, which limits the dynamical range of the atomic interferometer, wavefront curvature in lasers, and eliminating environmental noise. \r\n\r\nAn aspirational SWaP-C for a strategic-grade 6DOF IMU post-2020 is less than $750,000, 40 liters, 250 Watts, and 40 kg. Previous efforts by DARPA include PINS/High Dynamic Range Atom Sensors and Systems (HiDRA II) and Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator (C-SCAN). C-SCAN sought to create a 6DOF strategic-grade IMU based on atomic interferometry within a 1 cubic inch and 1-Watt package. The result was the production of a 2DOF IMU with strategic-grade performance as an accelerometer and navigation-grade performance as a gyroscope. A related effort, Cold Atom Microsystems (CAMS) dramatically reduced the SWAP-C of atomic clocks relative to chip-scale atomic clocks. The technology sought should focus on either improving contrast to create a super strategic-grade IMU or on reducing SWaP-C to produce a chip-scale IMU with performance comparable to the PINS/HiDRA II 2DOF IMU. \r\n\r\nThe technology should target one of three areas: component development, strategic-grade IMU development, or 6DOF navigation-grade IMU development. \r\n\r\nComponent development should focus on R&D in the area of compact lasers, modulators, shutters, vacuum systems, or small-scale electronics. Lasers should have narrow linewidth (10 dB), or low wavefront curvature (< 1 W) or pumpless. Electronics should be low power and ruggedized to support the other components. \r\n\r\nStrategic-grade IMU development should improve the quality of existing atomic interferometer sensor technology by improving performance or reducing SWaP-C as defined hereafter. The ideal IMU achieves continuous-strategic grade measurements at an instability of 1 nrad/s, obtains continuous measurements at a high frequency (> 100 Hz), eliminates background noise at the µrad/s level, and maintains contrast in a dynamic environment. These goals can be supported through many-photon momentum transfer, co-sensor integration, rotation compensation with mirrors, continuous-beam atomic sources, atom-number squeezing, atomic gradiometry, wave-front control, or other innovative methods. A proposed atomic interferometer sensor should be able to reduce SWaP-C without degrading performance or to improve performance without increasing SWaP-C. An IMU should cover as many degrees of freedom as possible. \r\n\r\nThe technology will undergo an independent evaluation at a Government-provided facility to show it will function in a maritime environment. An IMU should function to specification for an indoor ship-motion simulation test. Components should maintain performance for realistic variations in temperature, pressure, vibration, ship-motion, and supplied power but not ruggedized for warship shock and environmental conditions. System navigation performance shall be tested without continuous GPS aiding for a period of at least 100 hours to measure long-term performance and stability. \r\n\r\nNavigation-grade IMU development should produce a fully functional 6DOF based on currently existing atomic interferometer technology. Steps in this direction would be combining currently existing single-axis and dual-axis technology to produce a 6DOF navigation-grade IMU or developing ultra-low SWaP-C single and dual-axis devices, which will later be combined to form the full IMU. It is also possible to construct a 6-axis inertial sensor directly as was done by Canuel et al. in 2008. However, the final product should be field deployable in the marine environment using modular construction to fit through 24” doorway. The device should function on a dynamic platform with angular rates up to 0.3 rad/s, tilting of up to 60 degrees, and accelerations as high as 5 m/s (with SWaP equal to or less than 1110 lbs., 600VA max power draw with 600w max heat load, and 13 ft3 total volume, and functions in a shipboard environment. (0-95% humidity, 0-35oC). The technology sought will result in a resilient and accurate source of position and velocity information to U.S. Navy platforms. This information is needed to assure that platforms can meet mission need in the absence of GPS.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept that characterizes atomic interferometry sensors that improves the inertial sensors for maritime platforms. Establish feasibility of an approach through analysis, modeling, and simulation to show the concept will meet the required parameters in the Description. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design, develop, and deliver a prototype of the system described in Phase I. Demonstrate that the prototype meets the capabilities detailed in the Description during independent evaluation conducted at a Government-provided facility.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The prototype will be tested on a maritime platform to demonstrate performance of the prototype and the associated system. \r\n\r\nThe technology will be highly valuable in the shipping industry and any at-sea situations where GPS is not always available and high accuracy is a requirement. If SWaP support is needed, aircraft and spacecraft are additional platforms that would benefit. R&D in supporting components will also enhance commercial electronics and the development of other next-generation sensors.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKasevich, Mark and Chu, Steven. “Atomic interferometry using stimulated Raman transitions.” Physical Review Letters, 67 181, 8 July 1991. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.181  \r\n\tCanuel et al. “Six-Axis Inertial Sensor Using Cold-Atom Interferometry.” Physical Review Letters, 97 010402, 7 July 2006. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.010402   \r\n\tMueller et al. “A Compact Dual Atom Interferometer Gyroscope Based on Laser-cooled Rubidium.” European Physical Journal D., 53 3, 2009, pp. 273-281. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjd/e2009-00139-0 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_number": "N211-068",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sensors\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a small, affordable, lightweight, and dynamic antenna system to be mounted on a remote aerial low-altitude relay that will enable Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) communications between the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The MCM USVs execute missions for LCS MCM Mission Package (MP). The network communication services between LCS and the MCM USVs are provided by the Multiple Vehicle Communications System (MVCS), which uses direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications in the S-Band – more specifically, in the 2.2 to 2.4 GHz frequency band. Results of a recent analysis performed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) show that the Area Coverage Rate Sustained (ACRS) scores for the MCM USVs can be maximized by increasing the current maximum achievable range by a factor of 3-5. ACRS is one Measure of Effectiveness (MOE) typically used to evaluate MCM system performance, as shown in Reference 1. \r\n\r\nDue to the antenna heights for LCS (90 ft for Independence variant, 65 ft for Freedom variant) and the MCM USV (18 ft), a 3x-5x increase in range using direct LOS communications is unrealistic, as it is severely limited by the radio horizon from the curvature of the Earth’s surface. MCM MP data throughput requirements also effectively discard ground-wave propagation at lower frequencies as a possible solution, due to channel capacity limits. However, an intermediate relay node inserted between LCS and the MCM USV could enable a 3x-5x range increase and still meet MCM MP data throughput requirements without having to migrate to a different frequency band. This would allow having little to no change in communications equipment (i.e., radios, cables, amplifiers, and antennas) and configurations at the end nodes. Preliminary analysis and developmental test results have shown that an aerial relay at low altitudes – around 500 ft Above Sea Level (ASL) – should be sufficient to achieve the desired range increase. Not only would this be beneficial for the Navy, but also for the Marine Corps, who has shown an interest in developing a Long-Range USV (LR-USV) that can support its Expeditionary Advance Base Operations, as noted in Reference 2. \r\n\r\nA currently existing prototype relay system uses an azimuth-plane omni antenna to establish a communications link with the MCM USV, and a gimbaled directional antenna that relies on actuators to physically steer the antenna’s main beam towards LCS in the azimuth plane only – no direction finding in the elevation plane, as it always faces the horizon. Some of the concerns with the current prototype system include the following: Azimuth-plane omni antenna limits the communications range for the relay to MCM USV link and is susceptible to jamming from any direction; the gimbaled directional antenna can only scan as fast as the actuators allow, and is not expected to have good reliability or a long life cycle due to the actuators breaking down. These concerns open up the possibility of using other solutions, such as switched array and phased array antennas, which should increase the life cycle by reducing/eliminating the need for moving parts, as well as allowing for faster scanning and/or tighter beamforming, so that directivity is maximized in any desired direction. Typical phased array antenna characteristics and design considerations are described in Reference 3. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the technology is to produce a small, lightweight, and dynamic antenna system that can automatically beamform/beamsteer based on signal strength values reported from the radio. The antenna should be capable of handling fast beamforming/beamsteering to change beam directions between multiple end nodes. A secondary objective is for the antenna to implement null steering to avoid possible jamming sources. \r\n\r\nThere are multiple design constraints that should be observed, based on process modeling, operational experience, and optimization strategies: \r\n\r\nantenna system – elements and switching/driving electronics \r\n\r\n• should weigh less than 15 lbs \r\n\r\n• should be able to achieve a gain of 15 dBi or more with a 20 dB minimum mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio \r\n\r\n• should have full 360-degree coverage in the azimuth plane and 40-degree coverage in the elevation plane centered at 10 degrees below the horizon \r\n\r\n• should be able to handle 20 W average power (threshold) up to 40 W average power (objective) \r\n\r\n• should cover the entire 2.2 to 2.4 GHz frequency band \r\n\r\n• should not be more than 19 inches long and 15 inches in diameter \r\n\r\n• Should have a response time of 20 microseconds or less \r\n\r\n• should be environmentally sealed for protection against saltwater spray and continuous outdoor use \r\n\r\n• in support of the secondary objective, the antenna should be able to create nulls at least 30 dB below the mainlobe and steer them towards jammers, while maintaining a communications link with the intended target/s. \r\n\r\nCommercial antenna systems have been well developed for long-range communication systems in the S-Band, both for static and dynamic beam options. Switching/driving electronics for beamforming/beamsteering have also become robust. However, the challenge for this design, which necessitates innovative research & development, is being able to produce an antenna system with enough Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) to close long-distance communications for link rates of 24 Mbps or more; minimizing Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) without exceeding cost constraints; minimizing response time for beamforming/beamsteering; and being able to survive harsh marine environments.\r\n\r\nAny prototype antenna system developed as a result of this SBIR topic would be tested for its radiation characteristics – EIRP, directivity, beamsteering/beamforming, mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio, mainlobe-to-null ratio – in a laboratory setup (anechoic chamber) during the Phase II effort. The optimized version of the antenna system would then go through environmental and electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing to applicable military standards (e.g., MIL-STD-810G and MIL-STD-461F). At the end of Phase III, a Seminal Transition Event (STE) will be conducted via an Over The Air (OTA) test in an operationally relevant environment onboard a relay system, with multiple active end nodes. The antenna system will be expected to not interfere with existing MVCS and endpoint certifications, and abide by established MVCS certification boundaries. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an antenna concept that can meet the design constraints listed in the Description section. Establish feasibility by developing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models that show the antenna concept and provide estimated weight and dimensions of said antenna concept. Feasibility will also be established by computer-based simulations that show the antenna array’s beamforming/beamsteering capabilities are suitable for the project needs. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver a prototype antenna system for test and evaluation. Test the prototype antenna system, first in a controlled laboratory environment, then in an operationally relevant environment, to determine its capability to meet all relevant performance metrics outlined in the Phase II SOW. Demonstrate the prototype system performance in both environments to the Government and present the results in two separate test reports. Use the results to correct any performance deficiencies and refine the prototype into a pre-production design that will meet Navy requirements. Prepare a Phase III SOW to transition the technology to Navy use. Prepare a Phase III SOW that will outline how the technology will be transitioned for Navy use. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to the LCS MCM MP relay system. Work with the Navy to integrate the antenna system onto the relay platform. Support test, validation, certification, and qualification of the system through environmental qualification testing, and with an STE at the culmination of the effort. \r\n\r\nIn the military/government sector, results from Phase II and Phase III for the relay platform antenna system can be leveraged to create variants of the antenna system for use on the MCM USV and LCS platforms, as well as demonstrate the MCM USV capabilities to perform missions at extended ranges for the Marine Corps LR USV concept. In the commercial sector, antennas with beamforming/beamsteering capabilities and anti-jam protection through null-steering could have potential for use in private communication systems set in urban environments, where spectrum congestion and interference – intentional or unintentional – can be prevalent issues.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFrank, David; Hogan, Kevin and Schonhoff, Shane. “Application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to Compare Legacy and Future Forces in Mine Warfare (MIW) Missions.” Systems Engineering Capstone Project Report, SE311-132Open/Team MIW, Monterey, CA: Naval Postgraduate School, 2014, p. 359. https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/44659  \r\n\tEckstein, Megan. “Textron’s Common USV Ready for Production, Experimenting with Lethal Surface Warfare Payloads.” USNI News, January 22, 2020 (Updated: January 23, 2020). https://news.usni.org/2020/01/22/textrons-common-usv-ready-for-production-experimenting-with-lethal-surface-warfare-payloads#more-72882  \r\n\tMailloux, Robert J. “Phased Array Antenna Handbook, 2nd Edition.” Artech House: Norwood, MA, 2005. http://twanclik.free.fr/electricity/electronic/pdfdone11/Phased.Array.Antenna.Handbook.Artech.House.Publishers.Second.Edition.eBook-kB.pdf\r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) Partial Discharge and Space Charge Test Apparatus for Cable and Insulated Bus Pipe (IBP)",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-069",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an affordable test apparatus and test method for detecting Partial Discharge (PD), measuring Space Charge (SC), and estimating remaining service life of Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) cable and Insulated Bus Pipe (IBP) installed on naval ships, and to develop a Health Index and method to estimate remaining service life.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: An Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) offers the potential to provide revolutionary warfighting capability at an affordable cost. An IPES utilizes integrated energy storage and power along with advanced controls to provide a distribution bus suitable for servicing highly dynamic mission loads and propulsion demands while keeping the lights on. Additionally, such a system can enhance survivability, reliability, and flexibility while providing new capabilities such as the ability to quietly maneuver solely on energy storage. Currently, IPES development is focused on a MVDC system evolved from the DDG 1000 1kVDC Integrated-Fight-Through-Power system combined with shared and distributed energy storage as well as advanced controls with active state anticipation data linkage between machinery and combat systems. MVDC IPESs will be used on future surface combatants to affordably improve warfighting capability to meet evolving threats over the ship’s service life in an agile manner. As threat capabilities improve over the coming decades, the Navy is anticipated to rely more and more on high power, highly dynamic, and pulsed weapons and sensors. Because the need for generator synchronism is eliminated, MVDC is anticipated to be able to support these systems at lower cost, lower weight, and lower space requirements. Details on IPES are provided in the Naval Power & Energy Systems (NPES) Technology Development Roadmap. \r\n\r\nAs described in the NPES Technology Development Roadmap, ensuring service life of MVDC insulation is required for naval power and energy systems to support multiple future high power, pulsed sensors and weapons on future surface combatants. The ability to evaluate the health of MVDC insulation in installed cabling, insulated bus pipe (IBP) and their connections is critical to the successful implementation of MVDC and to avoid unplanned outages due to failed insulation systems. An important enabler to an MVDC system is a method to detect PD and measure the SC in the cable and/or IBP that has been installed onboard the ship during ship acceptance testing and periodically during the ship’s service life (Threshold) or continuously while the ship is operational (Objective). SC and voids in insulation of cables and IBP and their connections that operate above 1 kV can result in PD that can rapidly lead to failure of the cable / IBP insulation system. Traditional methods used for alternating current (AC) systems are not effective on MVDC systems. Existing methods for detecting PD in AC cables assume clean sinusoidal waveforms and are not suitable for MVDC systems with high frequency voltage ripple (See Ghosh, et al. [Ref 4] and Montanari, et al. [Ref 5]). SC in particular is unique to DC systems. Without an effective means to measure the health of the insulation system, the insulation system must incorporate large safety factors, resulting in thicker and heavier cables. Due to cable thickness limitations resulting from bend radius considerations, this conservative approach will require great expense and more cables of lower current capability to be paralleled together. \r\n\r\nThe power quality of MVDC on the shipboard distribution system shall be assumed to be in accordance with the “Preliminary Interface Standard, Medium Voltage Electric Power, Direct Current”. The test apparatus shall be compatible with nominal system voltages of 6 kV, 12 kV, and 18 kV and steady-state current ratings up to 8,000 amps. The test is anticipated to be conducted shipboard during the acceptance testing of the ship and prior to ship delivery to the U.S. Navy, and periodically during the ship’s service life (Threshold) or continuously while operational (Objective) to verify continued PD-free operation and to measure SC. \r\n\r\nMVDC systems are increasingly being used or considered for military and commercial applications (e.g., microgrids, offshore energy, wind farms, cruise ships). The test apparatus and test method will apply to these applications as well. \r\n\r\nInitially, the test apparatus and test method are anticipated to be used by NSWC Philadelphia personnel to verify PD-free operation and to measure SC. Eventually, shipyards and repair facilities are anticipated to be required to use the test apparatus and test method on applicable MVDC systems. The test method is intended to be formalized in a Test Method Standard in accordance with MIL-STD-962. If the objective is met, PD-free operation and SC measurements will be continuously monitored onboard ship. Estimated remaining life of the insulation system will be presented to the operator for maintenance planning.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an affordable method for detecting PD and measuring SC in MVDC distribution systems onboard naval ships. This concept must include a system design of the test apparatus and a draft test procedure. Develop and document a health index and method for estimating remaining service life of MVDC insulation in distribution system cabling / IBP. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept through modeling and simulation. Identify the technical risks of the concept. The Phase I Option, if exercised, shall include the design of experiments to address the technical risks and the procurement of long lead experiment articles and associated test equipment for execution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), conduct experiments to resolve technical risks. Employ the gained knowledge to develop a functional prototype of the test apparatus. Develop the test procedure, the health index calculation method, and the remaining service life estimate method. Validate performance of the test apparatus and test procedure initially through modeling and simulation, and then through testing.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Develop the final production test apparatus suitable for use onboard naval ships and finalize the test method as a draft Test Method Standard in accordance with MIL-STD-962. Validate the performance of the production test apparatus and draft a Test Method Standard through testing. Deliver a test apparatus to the Government in accordance with the Phase III Statement of Work. Update and deliver to the Government the health index calculation method and the remaining service life estimate method.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDepartment of Defense, “Defense Standards Format and Content,”MIL-STD-962, 5 November 2018.” https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=36064  \r\n\tDoerry, Norbert. \"Preliminary Interface Standard, Medium Voltage Electric Power, Direct Current.\" Naval Sea Systems Command, Technology Office (SEA 05T), Ser 05T / 002 of 16 January 2020. https://search.dtic.mil  – search for AD1090170  \r\n\tNaval Sea Systems Command. “Naval Power & Energy Systems (NPES) Technology Development Roadmap 2019.” https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Resources/NPES-Tech-Development-Roadmap/  \r\n\tGhosh, Riddhi; Seri, Paolo; Hebner, Robert and Montanari, Gian Carlo. “Noise Rejection and Detection of Partial Discharges under Repetitive Impulse Supply Voltage.” IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Vol 67, No 5, May 2020, pp. 4144-4151. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734896  \r\n\tMontanari, Gian Carlo; Hebner, Robert; Morshuis, Peter and Seri, Paolo. “An Approach to Insulation Condition Monitoring and Life Assessment in Emerging Electrical Environments.” IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol 34, No 4., August 2019, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8636225  \r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Lightweight Diver Handheld Underwater Hydraulic Friction Stud Welding System for 5000 Series Aluminum",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-070",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a lightweight diver handheld portable hydraulic friction stud welding system and welding procedures for 5000 series aluminum to support sustainment and readiness for underwater ship repairs and salvage on the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy has a need to wet weld aluminum studs on aluminum hull vessels to support underwater ship husbandry and emergency ship damage control, specifically on the LCS. Current underwater friction stud welding technology has been limited to carbon steel studs welded to carbon steel base plate material. Underwater friction stud welding using aluminum studs and base material has not been achieved commercially or within the Government. The equipment, whether pneumatic or hydraulic, is heavy and not adequately designed for safe use by divers performing underwater ship husbandry. A lightweight, diver friendly system that does not require special training or qualifications, and which could be used by Navy divers and Navy diving services contractors worldwide, is preferred for use in the field and during emergency ship damage control. \r\n\r\nResearch and development is required to further this technology in order to fill the Navy’s current gap to perform underwater wet welding on aluminum hull vessels. Development of this technology will give the Navy the capability to wet weld aluminum studs to aluminum hulls, which can be used to perform underwater ship husbandry that would normally require dry-docking. This technology can also be used to attach cofferdams to perform underwater hull maintenance and repairs, something that is not possible currently. Performing repairs in the water significantly reduces overall maintenance and life cycle costs in comparison to dry-dock repairs. Additionally, the technology could be used to support emergency ship damage control efforts, such as patch attachments. \r\n\r\nThe concept design should allow for 1/2-inch minimum stud diameter and 3/8-inch minimum plate thickness. The weld head (actual equipment operated by the diver) should be as light as possible with a dry weight of approximately 25 pounds and be mechanically driven with no electrical or digital requirements to operate. The design concept should allow for the weld head to be operated by a 150ft minimum umbilical length attached to a hydraulic power unit (HPU). The HPU would be located on the surface and not be required subsea. The HPU can have electrical/digital requirements. \r\n\r\nThe technology, along with the welded stud coupons, will be tested against the qualification requirements of NAVSEA Technical Publication, S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248, Requirements for Welding and Brazing Procedure and Performance Qualification and Department of Defense Manufacturing Process Standard, MIL-STD-1689A, Fabrication, Welding, and Inspection of Ship Structure.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept that will support fabrication of a prototype lightweight diver held hydraulic friction stud welding system capable of wet welding 5000 series aluminum (5086 stud to 5083 plate). \r\n\r\nThe feasibility of the concept shall be demonstrated as much as practicable by bread board bench testing and equipment prototyping. In addition, during this phase, the feasibility of welding 5086 studs to 5083 plate shall be demonstrated by welding coupons on a controlled environment and testing them by Non-Destructive and Destructive Test methods. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), a prototype system shall be developed and delivered to the Government for final test and evaluation. The system shall include the weld head (diver operated part of the system), umbilical, and hydraulic power unit. Perform initial evaluation of the system, including diver safety and ability to operate the weld head in the flat, vertical, and overhead positions, which can be in a shop environment without requiring any diving services. The system will also go through preliminary qualification testing based on a test plan developed by the Government IAW NAVSEA Technical Publication, S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248 and MIL-STD-1689A. Final test and evaluation will take place at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit, Panama City, FL.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Deliver an operational system to the Government for qualification testing in accordance with NAVSEA Technical Publication, S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248, Requirements for Welding and Brazing Procedure and Performance Qualification and Department of Defense Manufacturing Process Standard, MIL-STD-1689A, Fabrication, Welding, and Inspection of Ship Structure. Provide all studs and plate material required for qualification testing. Provide all required training to safely operate the system. \r\n\r\nAfter successful qualification, deliver the systems to the Navy’s Emergency Ship Salvage Material (ESSM) program where they will be maintained ready for issue. Train ESSM personnel in the operation, maintenance, and overhaul of the entire system.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a method to detect defects in thick-coated Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) and hybrid/integrated laminate construction.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Thick coated Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) laminate and hybrid/integrated laminate composites are used in critical component applications which demand that the component be free of defects of defined dimension and location. These defects include porosity, voids, delamination, moisture intrusion and defects in bond-line integrity. The configurations include FRP laminate (e.g., E-glass/vinyl ester, E-glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy), FRP hybrid laminates, FRP/viscoelastic polymer, FRP/foam, and FRP/wood. The defects have the potential to interfere with acoustic performance and structural integrity and generally degrade ship performance. \r\n\r\nShipyards are often required to remove coatings to permit inspection or remove components all together to permit inspection from both sides. Both of these scenarios are time-consuming and negatively affect the sustainment costs and maintenance schedule. An inspection method is needed that can identify defects in composite components through thick (>1/4”) coatings and from a single surface, thus increasing efficiency of inspections and decreasing ship impact during maintenance periods. \r\n\r\nCurrent nondestructive testing technologies (i.e., visual inspection [VT], ultrasonic testing [UT], eddy current testing [ET]) are limited in their ability to: \r\n\r\na) detect/quantify porosity in laminates/viscoelastic polymers \r\n\r\nb) detect bond-line defects \r\n\r\nc) detect water intrusion. The method to detect defects that the Navy seeks should be compatible with manufacturing, fabrication and in-service environments. \r\n\r\nThe method must be able to detect the range of identified defects and provide size and depth information, specifically, but not limited to: \r\n\r\na) Delaminations/voids in FRP:1/4” through 6” of material \r\n\r\nb) Porosity in FRP/viscoelastic polymers: >1% in a cubic foot of material \r\n\r\nc) Water intrusion: >5% by weight per cubic foot of laminate or FRP/core material \r\n\r\nd) Bond-line defects: 1/4” through 3” of material. \r\n\r\nThe method must be non-invasive (as opposed to destructive sampling), should demonstrate inspection time efficiency, and provide clear presentation of anomalies in the material, specifically in the selected regions of the material(s), such as a bond-line. Detection of disbonds in the FRP/coating bond-line is a highly desired outcome and an in-service inspection need. Detection of moisture in cored FRP sandwich construction is another desirable feature. These components are often accessible from one surface only, particularly for in-service inspection and covered with thick coatings. A nondestructive testing method applicable to these requirements is not commercially available. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define, develop, and demonstrate an inspection capability to detect and characterize the identified defects in representative sample material including porosity, voids, delamination, defects in bond-line integrity and moisture intrusion. Actual inspection capability shall be demonstrated (supported by analysis and/or simulation) for a variety of sample materials including coated and uncoated FRP laminate and FRP hybrid laminate composites. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include documentation of performance demonstration and conceptual specification of a practical nondestructive testing system to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and qualify a robust nondestructive evaluation system for detection and characterization of the specified defects in coated and uncoated FRP laminates, FRP hybrid laminates, FRP/viscoelastic polymer, FRP sandwich construction including foam and wood cored construction. These defects include porosity, voids, delamination, defects in bond-line integrity and moisture intrusion. The detection capability must be quantifiable through demonstrations with representative samples. . Note: NAVSEA will define the defect characteristics; and specify equipment characteristics appropriate for use during fabrication, installation, and in-service inspection. Representative equipment will be demonstrated. \r\n\r\nWork with NAVSEA to determine representative standards for each of the targeted defects. NAVSEA will provide samples incorporating various defects for laboratory validation by the contractor. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A portable, robust, efficient, and effective nondestructive inspection system for detection and characterization of defects in coated and uncoated FRP laminates, FRP hybrid laminates, FRP/viscoelastic polymer, FRP sandwich construction has a large potential commercial market. The capability validated in Phase II will translate directly into similar technical performance requirements in commercial market applications. As for Phase III transition, this work will benefit the following industrial applications: \r\n\r\na) Reinforced rubber products for volumetric inspection. Applications include expansion joints in power plants and chemical processing facilities. \r\n\r\nb) Multi-layer armor, primarily for military applications (and some civilian law enforcement). \r\n\r\nc) Multi-layer composites for wind turbine blade application. \r\n\r\nd) Part quality of polymer composites for automotive and marine applications. \r\n\r\ne) Ceramic matrix composites, primarily for aerospace applications, both military and civilian. \r\n\r\nf) High density polyethylene (HDPE) joint inspections, specifically thermal butt fusion weld joining, for failure to properly fuse. \r\n\r\ng) Fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) for absolute thickness and inter-layer disbond, specifically for FRP pipe and tank inspection in chemical processing, oil and gas as well as municipal infrastructure.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMultiple contributing authors. “American Society of Nondestructive Testing Aerospace Industry Handbook.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a capability that will enable the planning and execution of autonomous anchoring evolutions scalable in operation for both Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MUSV) and Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) applications.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The current state-of-the-art in anchor evolutions is manpower intensive requiring a user in the loop to both choose the location as well as execute and monitor the sequence of actions such as, but not limited to, the lowering and securing of the anchor. Innovations in process and method by which the Navy conducts anchor handling evolutions are required to ensure both safety and reliability while eliminating the required manpower necessary to enable truly autonomous operations for future unmanned surface vehicles. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks to develop an autonomous anchor handling system able to conduct a routine anchoring event with no human intervention. This includes planning for and selecting the anchoring location and then securely placing the anchor while continuously monitoring and adjusting as needed based upon the needs of the vehicle. Proposers will likely need to address not only the automation of the anchor handling machinery onboard the USVs, but the decision making autonomy that would provide the oversight and control of the event itself. \r\n\r\nMultiple factors are considered when planning an anchorage location. These factors include: location, anchor to be used, depth of water, type of bottom, scope of chain to be used, drag and swing circles, and planned route, heading, and velocity profile in order to arrive at an anchoring location at 1 knot or less to pay out chain. Proposed anchor planning system concepts should be able to command the anchor handling equipment to place the anchor in a safe [Ref 5] manner upon arriving at desired anchorage point. After dropping anchor, the anchor planning system should identify if the anchor is dragging, the chain is tending across the stem (lead around the ship’s bow), or if other ships are entering the drag and swing circles and take appropriate action. If the anchor planning or handling system determines the anchor is dragging, the planning system should take appropriate action, such as steaming to the anchor, directing the handling system to let out additional chain, or to weigh anchor and getting underway. The system shall autonomously manage and execute a plan on weighing anchor, including bearing and speed to ride the anchor chain, command the anchor machinery to lift the anchor, and provide confirmation to the vessel that it is safe to begin steaming. The system will need to include a troubleshooting function that indicates failure modes and system status as well as providing data to allow for the capability of remote operation. \r\n\r\nAn automated anchor handling system should be able to accept commands from a higher level system (autonomously as well as human in or on the loop) and be able to automatically handle, drop, and weigh the anchor. Equipment shall be no smaller than Equipment Numeral U7 and no larger than Equipment Numeral U15 in Table 1, 2019 American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Steel Vessel Rules (SVR) 3-5-1 (available at ww2.eagle.org – see p.346.) The largest anticipated anchor will weigh 1,590 kg, and will be a Stockless Bower type. Anchor chain is traditionally made up of 90 foot sections (or “shots”) of solid links. Each shot is joined to its neighbor by a single detachable link. The largest anticipated anchor chain diameter is 40 mm, using Chain Cable Stud Link Bower Chain. The anchor chain will be 900 feet long. The maximum force on the anchor and chain can be calculated from the preceding information together with Section 4-5-1 (pp. 414-418) of the ABS SVR. When the vessel has paid out the desired scope of chain, it is positioned so that a detachable link is on deck. This practice facilitates leaving the anchor behind in an emergency (“slipping anchor”) if the anchor windlass is inoperative and the vessel must get underway. Modifications to the traditional anchor, chain, and handling equipment in order to facilitate a fully automated process are to be considered within the design tradespace. Proposers should keep in mind the desire to have a scalable system that is Mobile Open Systems Approach (MOSA) compliant to allow for compatibility with future USVs. To ensure interoperability with planned and future USVs, solutions must also comply with the PMS 406’s Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA). UMAA establishes a standard for common interfaces and software reuse among the mission autonomy and the various vehicle controllers, payloads, and Command and Control (C2) services in the PMS 406 portfolio of unmanned systems (UxS) vehicles. The UMAA common standard for Interface Control Documents (ICDs) mitigates the risk of unique autonomy solutions applicable to just a few vehicles allowing flexibility to incorporate vendor improvements as they are identified; effects cross-domain interoperability of UxS vehicles; and allows for open architecture (OA) modularity of autonomy solutions, control systems, C2, and payloads. The Navy will provide the open standards for UMAA upon award of Phase I.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept design for an anchor planning and handling system. The Government will provide the UMAA documentation in support of future Phase II proposal development. Deliver a concept design for reliable, safe, and repeatable operations, including any modeling and simulation, studies, or prototypes in support of concept risk reduction. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will deliver a preliminary design of the concept, identifying the baseline design (hardware, software, support systems) and underlying architectures to ensure that the concept has a reasonable expectation of satisfying the requirements. See paragraph 4-5-1/7 on p. 417 of ABS SVR part 4 for Shop Inspection and Testing, and see paragraph 3-7-2/1 on p. 371 of SVR part 3 for Anchor Windlass Trials.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a critical design prior to fabrication of the system or major system components for company testing. The system developed under the Phase II shall comply with MOSA and UMAA. The detailed design must meet the performance, cost, and schedule requirements. It will also identify the necessary interfaces, dependencies, and risks. After a successful Critical Design Review (CDR), develop a prototype(s). Testing and certification of the planning portion of the system will consist of simulation with the vessel of opportunity’s autonomy. Testing and certification of the handling portion of the system will consist of hardware-in-the-loop testing.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Successful anchor planning and handling systems will transition to either the MUSV program or the LUSV program. UMAA compliant anchoring planning software and anchoring systems for Navy USVs would have applicability to the commercial unmanned surface vehicles already widely in use further expanding their ability to adapt to their operational environment and conduct autonomous operations.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBaker, Clifford C.; Malone, Thomas and Krull, Russell D. “Survey of Maritime Experiences in Reduced Workload and Staffing.” Carlow International Inc,, Falls Church, VA, No. CGR/DC-292/99, 1999. https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a372260.pdf   \r\n\tSchank, John F.; Yardley, Roland J.; Riposo, Jessie; Thie, Harry J.; Keating, Edward G.; Arena, Mark V.; Pung, Hans; Birkler, John and Chiesa, James. \"Options for reducing costs in the United Kingdom’s future aircraft carrier (CVF) programme.\" Rand, 2005. https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG240.html  \r\n\tPardo, Miguel Lamas; Carral Couce, Luis; Castro-Santos, Laura and Carral Couce, Juan Carlos. \"A review of the drive options for offshore anchor handling winches.\" Brodogradnja: Teorija i praksa brodogradnje i pomorske tehnike 68, no. 3, 2017, pp. 119-134. https://hrcak.srce.hr/181474  \r\n\tJiang, Huilue and Luo, Fei. \"A Direct Torque Controlled Anchor System Design.\" 2015 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Research and Mechatronics Engineering, Atlantis Press, 2015. https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/isrme-15/18531  \r\n\tNoel, John V.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an intelligent assistant that improves active sonar detection, classification, and tracking and enables operators to maximize the potential of the tactical sonar suite.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Navy Cruisers and Destroyers engaged in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) often use active sonar to perform detection, classification, and localization (DCL) of submerged threats. Active sonar employment involves numerous operational modes and settings that enable operators to adapt the sonar suite to the environment and current tactical goals or operational posture. This includes employment decisions such as changing the operational mode between pulsed active sonar (PAS) and continuous active sonar (CAS) as well as changing waveform and various other system settings. Operators must conduct sonar analysis of resulting sonar returns and interpret them based on the sonar settings and the environment. \r\n\r\nIntelligent assistants are now commonplace in commercial industry but cannot be used in Navy systems. Similar tools do not exist to support operators of the tactical sonar suite. Effective employment of the sonar suite and analysis of the information it presents in complex and changing conditions creates a significant cognitive demand for operators. The Navy seeks to develop an intelligent assistant through leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to support operators in this complex decision-making process. \r\n\r\nAn innovative intelligent assistant utilizing AI would bring together environmental information from the on-board tactical decision aid (TDA), in-situ, real-time assessment of the environment, and machine-learning algorithms to provide operators situational awareness regarding key parameters such as primary propagation path(s), bearing-dependent complications (such as sea mounts that might obscure threats), significant topology features into which a threat might retreat to minimize detection, best tactical waveforms, and situational best practices to enable operators to maximize the potential of the tactical sonar suite for the specific conditions present at that time and location. This assistant would have a significant analysis component, but would also have a direct interface with the operator through additional display elements and/or updates to existing display elements. In addition to realizing performance gains of at least 25% on active sonar detection, active sonar classification, active sonar tracking and end-to-end metrics relative to naïve employment of the system, this will enhance affordability by reducing the training time needed to realize a given level of operational performance. The technology developed will be tested using the IWS 5.0 Advanced Capability Build (ACB) step testing process. The seminal transition event will be validation by the Government and show the technology performs as required. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

If needed, coordination with the Government will occur to conduct testing at a Government- or company-provided facility to validate the prototype’s capabilities.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an efficient and secure data management software application to use Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) to sustain, maintain and modernize ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy operates ships that are technologically advanced and dependent on the effective application of information. The Navy needs a data analytics system that provides real-time ship performance and component-level data to affordably sustain the Fleet. Integrating the two initiatives of monitoring ship performance and securely transmitting ship performance data promises to transform the conduct of maintenance and the relationship of the ship and the shipyard. \r\n\r\nComprehensive understanding of a ship’s current material condition is critical to maintenance performance. Traditionally, shipyard personnel assess the ship’s material condition through ship visits and ship checks, ship system logs, the Consolidated Ships Maintenance Plan, previous work packages of the ship and other ships in its class, along with other sources of maintenance information. Visits are performed during the planning phase through scheduled ship visits, and just prior to start of a planned maintenance availability. However, as a preparatory method for planning an availability, this is insufficient for preparing the shipyard when execution of the work package reveals unanticipated maintenance problems, which increases costs and delays in schedule. \r\n\r\nThe Navy needs a secure data management system to share performance data between ships at sea and shipyards. Ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines operating at sea produce a tremendous amount of information. CBM, as a predictive concept, utilizes engineered maintenance standards based on objective historical conditions and predicted failure windows in order to determine when a component is due for maintenance. There is a concern that CBM has gone too far and disrupted the shipyard’s ability to properly plan for large maintenance availabilities. In a data-managed environment, ship CBM and RCM parameters could technically flag ship system components based on performance criteria, generate lists of system and component status, generate prioritized task lists and automated work packages, and based on actual conditions, work lists could be generated and assigned to either the ship’s force or the shipyard. Where CBM and RCM is automated, maintenance in a continuum and planning for large maintenance availabilities could focus on delivering capability to the ship, modernizing systems, structures and conducting major upgrades and alterations. \r\n\r\nThe Navy is currently testing the Enterprise Remote Monitoring (ERM) System to monitor ship systems and components while at sea. In effect, it will function as a sensor that monitors and collects vital performance data on a ship’s hull, mechanical and electrical systems and components. When hosted in such a way as to securely transmit data, in effect, the operators are connected with the maintainers for continuous maintenance support anytime and anywhere. This specific effort looks to leverage the ERM by establishing an architecture option for a software solution or suite of software that orchestrates the movement and processing of the data in such a manner that it can be scaled to advance capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe secure sharing of performance data through the ERM between a naval shipyard and a ship will deliver enhanced capability, resources and life cycle support enabling the integration of advances in technology, and a continuous planning process that aligns the current material condition of the ship with the capabilities of the shipyard. In a future state, the Navy could expand its planning and execution capabilities through simulation in a digital environment using all available information to create an instance-based digital twin of the ship, enabled by its digital thread, a record of its life cycle support, and sustainment activities. A digital twin for a ship can help the shipyard community identify, plan, track and test its repair needs in advance of an availability. \r\n\r\nThe production solution should be able to meet security requirements consistent with the DoD Risk Management Framework at the appropriate level. See NIST SP 800-53 for detail requirements. If a cloud solution is used, the system must also meet the requirements of the DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide at Impact Level 4. It is not necessary to demonstrate compliance during the prototype effort; however, details of compliance capability should be provided in the deployment plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept for secure sharing of ship performance data between naval shipyards and ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines using the Navy’s ERM System. The Phase I Option, if exercised, would include the initial layout and capabilities description to build a prototype in Phase II. Phase I testing should align with industry standards and best practices to ensure that investments drive value to the predictive maintenance community.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop a prototype for testing and evaluating the primary source data from a naval vessel and transmitted to a naval shipyard. This source data is expected to be sensitive and or classified, varied in type, and centrally available for further analysis, model building and visualizations to determine ship material condition and optimize planning activities for an upcoming major availability.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a tabletop radar range leveraging high-resolution 3D printing and nanophotonics to serve as an optical emulator for complex electromagnetic (EM) systems.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy currently uses both simulation and measurement of a ship’s Antenna- Radar Cross Section (RCS) to improve the design of new stealthy antenna on platforms and to ensure the accurate measure beam profile of the antenna in an environment. However, EM simulations are extremely challenging for large and complex objects that involve multiple constituent materials and fine details. Direct Antenna-RCS measurements may not be possible if the ship is part of an adversarial navy or if the ship is at sea. Currently DoD evaluates its antenna EM radiation beam profile using simulation and an actual measurement in anechoic chamber and field measurement. The process of doing such measurement is expensive and time consuming. It is also impossible to create a real-life scenario of EM reflection from other structure during actual operation of the system. This topic shall address such real-life scenarios with fabrication in nanophotonics and use nanaophotonic radiation to characterize and simulate the EM scattering map without any anechoic chamber or infield measurement. This approach shall also reduce cost two orders of magnitude and time reduction from a year to a week. \r\n\r\nSubmarines may be subjected to high power laser beams and microwave radiation, which may damage optics and sensors in beam directors and periscopes. The Navy is seeking a technology that would demonstrate the possibility to accurately measure the radar antenna cross section & beam profile of large and complex antenna with a scaling factor of 100,000 under different environments such as sea surface with varying degrees of wave action and other EM radiation interference from adjacent masts on own-ship and nearby vessels. The advantages of this scaling approach is its versatility, and the possibility to perform fast, convenient, and inexpensive measurements on structures whose sizes prevent simulation, even with today’s computers. This proposed technique shall also reduce cost (two orders of magnitude) and time (from a year to a week). This technique, based on the scale invariance of Maxwell’s equations, leverages nano-scale 3D printing, as well as the availability of a variety of laser sources and high resolution detectors in 1 micron near infrared wavelength. \r\n\r\nInteraction with Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) personnel has revealed that one of the difficulties facing the development of new Navy platforms is optimizing the placement of antennas to minimize interference between antennas. The proposed method of using small-scale models and plasmonic-nanoantennas to simulate the EM field is estimated to provide a reduction in cost by a factor 1/150, and time by a factor 1/365. \r\n\r\nInstead of needing a large anechoic chamber, the RCS measurements are done on a tabletop setup with highly detailed micron scale model. The models are illuminated with an external source of light, and the scattered energy is detected with a charge couple device (CCD), similarly to a monostatic radar configuration. The direct 2D imaging of the scattered field allows us to identify the parts of the structure responsible for the RCS signal. This information is similar to what is obtained with an Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) measurement but without the back projection computation. Measurement reliability shall also be demonstrated by comparing the results with a theoretical EM model for any shape under different environments. \r\n\r\nThe EM signatures of an antenna in a platform, such as a ship or a submarine, are of particular importance for the Navy since they allow the detection and identification of the antenna system and its performance on the platform. The vessel’s active EM signature (EM Antenna), known as its radar cross section (Antenna-RCS), is proportional to the reflectivity of the structure and varies with relative spatial orientation of the vessel and the radar source. Minimizing this reflection improves the antenna performance of a radar system. The observed Antenna-RCS can also be used to improve the platform antenna performance. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Nano antenna compact radar range program is to design and develop a tabletop radar-range system capable of measuring the EM signature of large and complex structures, including the antenna emission (gain) and their interference.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Provide a concept and determine the feasibility of the concept for the EM emission of a nanoantenna in the framework of tabletop radar range as well as simulations of antenna emission in the presence of simple geometrical shapes. Provide an assessment on how the dipole plasmonic nanoantenna will be manufactured using liftoff microstructuring technique as well as characterize the antenna emission direction. Liftoff lithography is a method of creating structures (patterning) of a target material on the surface of a substrate (e.g., wafer) using a sacrificial material (e.g., photoresist). It is an additive technique as opposed to more traditional subtracting technique like etching. The scale of the structures can vary from the nanoscale up to the centimeter scale or further, but are typically of micrometric dimensions. The nanoantenna will potentially be transferred on a relevant model and the gain compared to its original profile as well as the simulation.) \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if awarded, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype system for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). Design, build, and demonstrate a prototype tabletop RCS system based on the proof of concept developed during Phase I. Demonstrate the ability to collect antenna emission measurements of a vessel of interest in near marine boundary conditions including realistic sea clutter. Fabricate a RCS system based on the prototype developed in the base period. \r\n\r\nField test the nanophotonic radar-range system at one of the Navy’s facilities. Fabricate an active nanoantenna device that can be used to simulate the radar signal generated by the vessel’s radar systems. The testing will consist of measuring the RCS of a specific model, of which the design will be provided by the Navy. A scaled model will be made using a nano-3D printer (not deliverable), and the RCS measurement will be measured using the nanophotonic radar-range. The result of the measurement will be a RCS polar plot that can used by the Navy to compare with life scale measurement and/or simulation.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use for antenna performance evaluation and location of the antenna for best performance. Army and Navy can use this technology to simulate the environment scenario to optimize the EM beam profile and its performance. \r\n\r\nThe nanophotonic radar-range system can be used for emulating the RCS of a large variety of platforms, from small boats like the 4M RX Rigid Inflatable with 12ft length to much larger vessels like the Gerald R. Ford class super carrier. The system can also be applied to all classes of submarines in near boundary conditions, including the Virginia and Columbia classes, as well as to measure the RCS of the AN/BVS-1 photonic mast. The nanophotonic radar-range system can find commercial use with any DoD branches and contractors desiring to understand the radar cross section properties of their platforms. This technique can be used during any phase of construction: development, production or refurbishing. It can also be used to acquire the RCS of structures that are inaccessible such as non-friendly nation platforms. For example, a contractor such as General Dynamics can use the system to better understand the RCS of the next generation of ships such as the USS Zumwalt. A contractor such as Raytheon can use the system to better understand the RCS of an enemy target to better detect, acquire, and follow that target with radar. \r\n\r\nThe technology shall also be used in telecommunication industry and TV to survey the antenna site before they actually do the field survey to optimize the reception and service broader spectrum customers. The system can find dual use application for the development of the 5G telecommunication to better understand the propagation of the signal in cluttered environment such as dense urban center. A Global System for Mobile operator can potentially use the nanophotonic radar-range system to optimize the location of their antennas to avoid dead signal zone.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBlanche, P.A. et al. “A 100,000 Scale Factor Radar Range.“ Scientific Reports, 7, 17767, 2017. https://no-click.mil/?https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18131-1  \r\n\tBlanche, P.A. et al., “A 300 THz tabletop radar range system with sub-micron distance accuracy.” Scientific Reports, 8:14443, 2018. https://no-click.mil/?https://rdcu.be/7SDy  \r\n\tNovotny, L. and van Hulst, N. “Antennas for light.” Nat.

"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-076",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Sensors\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a concept for an autonomous or unmanned method to determine a vessel’s draft accurately (Objective 1/16”; Goal 1/8”) during required naval architectural experiments in various weather conditions with various hull forms to support on-time delivery of ships and submarines.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Naval architectural experiments (i.e., inclining experiment and displacement check) are conducted prior to ship delivery to the fleet; avoiding schedule delays of these experiments by removing the small boat portion prevents delays of on-time delivery. The existing method can be hazardous and requires a manned small boat to collect draft readings at four locations (port and starboard; bow and stern) using a draft tube. Draft readings with draft tubes rely on personnel judgment due to reading the meniscus in the equipment that is not standardized between shipyards and may result in inconsistencies in draft readings taken. As much as practicable, the system developed should be used by shipyards to standardize the process of taking draft readings during naval architectural experiments. The system developed should be more efficient with at least a 50% reduction in time and/or labor (reduced schedule risk and reduced labor and travel costs), accurate (Objective 1/16”; Goal 1/8”), safer, and completely autonomous method to determine the draft of a vessel when conducting naval architectural experiments. The system should reduce schedule risk to on-time delivery and reduce costs associated with these experiments. The system developed will require fewer people (less cost) for the experiment, reduce risk of experiment delay due to the weather conditions that prohibit the small boat from going in the water to measure drafts (could mean up to ~100 people wasting 8 hours waiting for weather and ~20 people staying an extra night to perform the experiment the next day), and shorten the duration of the process in its entirety. The system should be operable in various weather conditions, including several feet of chop on the water surface and wind; and be able to determine draft on various hull forms including flared (e.g., carrier) or tumble homed (e.g., submarine) hulls and draft marks. Draft marks have a projected height of six inches but can be longer on the hull depending on the hull’s curvature. This SBIR topic will contribute to reducing life-cycle costs (these experiments are performed throughout a vessel’s life) while leveraging technology and data analytics. Observation of the draft marks and water surface could be recorded and the video could be converted to data to perform statistical analysis to obtain the average draft while the water surface perturbates. The existing method relies on personnel judgment to average out the perturbations and record an average reading, which is not objective, repeatable or standardized. Additionally, an autonomous system will allow the data collected to be stored and analyzed later whereas with the existing method, the reading is taken and a photograph is taken but they are difficult to verify or analyze later due to the angle of the photograph, lighting conditions, and timing of the photograph with wave action. These experiments require the vessel to be nearly complete and occur within days or weeks of delivery so any delays in accomplishing these experiments can impact on-time delivery of ships and submarines. There are approximately 20-25 experiments per year across the submarine fleet and 10-15 experiments per year across surface ships and aircraft carriers. These experiments are necessary to ensure the stability and safety of US Navy ships and submarines, are required by NAVSEA, and are applicable to submarines, surface ships, and aircraft carriers. The technological solution would likely be a device that the shipyards (both public and private) would procure. Utilizing an autonomous method to determine the draft of a vessel would reduce the set-up time and equipment needed, streamlining the process and reducing cost and schedule risk, and would not put personnel at risk (personnel have fallen into cold water and have almost been crushed between boat and pier).\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for reading draft marks to sufficient accuracy (as stated in the Description) on submarines and surface ships during naval architectural experiments. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype based on Phase I work for demonstration and validation. Demonstrate the operation of the prototype to read draft marks with various hull forms and various weather conditions to sufficient accuracy as stated in the Description. The new system will be compared to results obtained using the traditional method by shadowing an experiment with the new system and/or using the ghost fleet in Philadelphia or a barge since they may provide easier access than an active Navy shipyard with commissioned boats. Deliver the tested device and associated software at the end of Phase II. \r\n\r\nThe prospective contractor may require access to U.S. shipyards (public and/or private) or other U.S. Naval facilities to demonstrate the capability. The system likely includes software so the software would have to meet applicable Navy requirements (e.g., IA, cyber, COTS).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to integrate the Phase II-developed device and software into standard operating procedures at the shipyards and standards at NAVSEA for Fleet-wide use on submarines, surface ships and aircraft carriers. \r\n\r\nThe commercial shipping industry also performs inclining experiments to meet U.S. Coast Guard and/or classification society standards so U.S. or foreign shipyards may be interested in this device.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTsujii, Takahiro; Yoshida, Hiromi and Iiguni, Youji. “Automatic draft reading based on image processing.” Optical Engineering, 55(10), 14 October 2016. https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/optical-engineering/volume-55/issue-10/104104/Automatic-draft-reading-based-on-image- processing/10.1117/1.OE.55.10.104104.full?SSO=1 \r\n\tHirono, Kouhei; Sera, Wataru; Fuchi, M. and Kinzo, Inoue. “A Theoretical Study of the Draft Reading Device.” The Journal of Japan Institute of Navigation, March 2006. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312351203_A_Theoretical_Study_of_the_Draft_Reading_Device  \r\n\tPowers, Earl. “Development and Use of a Tool to Accurately Measure Freeboards.” SNAME, SMC-2019-55. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SNAME-SMC-2019-055  \r\n\t“Are Drones the Future of Marine Surveying?” Martek Marine, 9 Jun 2017. https://www.martek-marine.com/blog/are-drones-the-future-of-marine-surveying/ \r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Non-towed Broadband Acoustic Source",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-077",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an innovative, acoustic source for operation from an 11-m unmanned surface vehicle (USV) producing the required output.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) -based systems require lighter weight, lower drag, and smaller footprint products than their legacy counterparts [Ref 1]. There are currently a number of technology development efforts for various types of sensors and emitters that will be suitable for integration with a Fleet-class (11-meter) USV. However, many of these sensors and emitters are towed systems, which result in increased drag and fuel consumption, as well as reduced capability in shallow water and constrained waterways [Ref 2]. By eliminating the towed system from the USV, a reduction in towed system drag on the craft will result in increased endurance for the system while operating at the same speed. This will increase system capability by potentially increasing the coverage rate and allowing its use in shallower water and constrained waterways than current towed systems. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Navy is seeking an innovative acoustic source capable of generating a broad range of outputs that would be mounted either above the waterline, within the hull and structure of the USV, or if a solution were sub-surface, the acoustic generator would be stowed above the waterline or within the USV hull-form until performing operations. The acoustic source(s) will be capable of being operated in very shallow water (20-40 ft), have low/no-drag (drag is constrained by the propulsive power used), and be non-towed or easily deployed/retrieved from the USV (less than 10 below the keel of the vehicle). Use of USV propulsion and hull systems, as well as legacy methods (e.g., mechanical cavitation, spark gap) is encouraged. The system must be lightweight (less than 400 lb.); require minimal electrical or propulsion power (less than 30 kw electrical power; Propulsive Power 125 hp); have a high acoustical power radiation (minimum 175 dB re 1 µPa @ 1m (1/3 Octave Band Level), frequency range of 10 Hz to 32 kHz, broadband white noise or multiple tones distributed over the required bandwidth, omni-directional or forward hemisphere transmission from one or several generators); and mitigate the effects of craft speed and its variations (12-18 kts, ±5 kt speed variation). The acoustic generator will be autonomously activated by the USV’s central command and control. \r\n\r\nOfferors are encouraged to propose concepts that use waste energy from the USV (e.g., exhaust, propulsion noise, flow) that is amplified, controlled, and manipulated by the concept to generate the desired output. Legacy concepts (e.g., mechanical cavitation, spark gap) are also encouraged. Sets of transducers may not be viewed as novel technology for this topic unless of a new form or application, or offering unique capabilities in the operating environment is articulated. Offerors should note the likely presence of cavitation in the operation of their system and, if relevant, should address in their proposals how the system mitigates its effects, or uses it to a beneficial effect. \r\n\r\nBy eliminating towed items, the towed system drag to the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) can be reduced by up to 50%. That savings will result in a lower fuel burn rate and an increased endurance. An increase in endurance will increase the capability of the USV and multiple payloads can be carried on the USV for multiple mission sets. Dragging these systems through the seawater increase the life-cycle cost based on the maintenance associated with the seawater environment. By removing the acoustic source from the water, the mean time before maintenance will increase which will reduce the life-cycle cost of these systems.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an acoustic generator meeting the requirements in the Description. Feasibility of the concept for an innovative acoustic generator that meets the needs of the Navy as defined in the Description will be demonstrated by modeling and simulation, analysis, and/or laboratory experimentation, as appropriate. Acoustic output (frequency range, amplitude) will be the key quantitative performance parameter, with the level of speed independence, and size/weight/power being key system attributes. The effect of cavitation on the system performance, if relevant, should be clearly presented through the concept development and feasibility demonstration. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and fabricate a prototype acoustic generator based on the Phase I work and Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) for demonstration and characterization of key performance parameters, key system attributes, and objectives. At the end of Phase II, prototype acoustic generator components shall be tested according to Navy requirements. Testing of the key performance parameters and key system attributes will be an at-sea test over an acoustic range to verify that the task objectives were met. Based on lessons learned in Phase II through the prototype demonstration, a substantially complete design of the acoustic generator should be completed and delivered that would be expected to pass Navy qualification testing.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy use. The final acoustic generator product will need to conform to all specifications and requirements. A full-scale prototype will be operationally tested at sea on an acoustic range and certified by the Navy to be integrated with an USV for further performance testing.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRoberts, Scott D. “Stability Analysis Of A Towed Body For Shipboard Unmanned Surface Vehicle Recovery.” Thesis, The Naval Post Graduate School, Monterey, CA, 2005. www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a432512.pdf   \r\n\t“US Coast Guard.

"topic_description": " \r\n\r\nRT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Machine Learning/AI\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an analytical toolset that mines sonar operator performance data via the tactical system along with training data gathered from the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The AN/SQQ-89 A (V)15 system collects a large amount of data from which it is possible to infer sonar operator performance data. The interactions that the operators have with the system can provide valuable insights into the fleet’s training readiness. Applying Big Data mining techniques, methodologies, and analysis to the sonar system of the SQQ-89 would enable more relevant and real-time decision-making. The Chief of Naval Operation (CNO) has stated that there is a need to “Establish data-driven decisions as a foundation for achieving readiness in our warfighting enterprises. Lead Type Commands (TYCOMs), supported by Systems Commands (SYSCOMs), Budget Submitting Offices, and higher echelons will develop and maintain authoritative and accessible data for decision-quality information.” By coupling artificial intelligence (AI) that mines the SQQ-89’s operator performance data with learning analytics mined via machine learning applied to the Moodle LMS, decision-makers would possess the data necessary to make more informed decisions. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the CNO desires to “Focus Navy efforts for fielding artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms on areas that most enhance warfighting, training, and corporate decisions.” The current state of learning analytics used in the Moodle LMS include simple metrics such as activity completion and quiz/exam scores but lack the power to contribute to the understanding of student learning. An AI/ML toolset would provide the power necessary to measure an operator’s abilities and determine areas for improvement quickly and accurately over traditional assessments. Currently no tools exist that can provide this capability. Obtaining this toolset would benefit the Navy by decreasing operational costs. Training should use study time more efficiently than the chosen control conditions so participants did not waste time studying items they already knew and were able to concentrate on items that require more training maximizing the operator’s time and increasing training efficiency. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks an AI/ML toolset that captures data generated by operators interacting with the SQQ-89 system as well as the Moodle LMS hosted on the tactical system. The AI/ML toolset must also be able to format that data using “strategies to transform data into appropriate forms, to include smoothing, attribute construction, aggregation, normalization, and discretization (Susnea, pg. 74).” Such formatting would show patterns and provide additional insights into an operator’s performance and behavior while using the SQQ-89. \r\n\r\nIn addition to formatting the data, the toolset must be able to perform descriptive modeling, which is a mathematical process that describes real-world events and the relationships between factors responsible for them. The toolset must also perform data analysis through predictive modeling, which is a process that uses data mining and probability to forecast outcomes. The toolset must also visualize the data in an easily digestible format to ease a decision-maker’s ability to make better and more informed decisions quickly and with high confidence in the data. \r\n\r\nInitial testing of the AI/ML toolset may be demonstrated at the contractor facility but a more robust evaluation of a fully developed toolset will be conducted using representative data gathered from a fleet test event, at a developer site such as the Lockheed Martin Anti-Submarine Warfare Laboratory in Manassas, VA, or from an appropriate Navy training facility such as Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Center San Diego, CA. (FASW-TC). In order to properly evaluate the toolset, the test should include data from a team of sonar operators and their interactions with the SQQ-89 tactical system. Ideally, the interactions would include real-world or synthetic scenarios that span the detect-to-engage timeline. In addition to the data derived from the tactical system, a fully populated Moodle LMS comprised of training data from each of the participants of the sonar team would be preferred as the AI/ML toolset will need to uncover findings and correlations between the two sets of data. \r\n\r\nMetrics used to assess the AI/ML toolset will refer to data quality, which can be defined as the degree to which a set of characteristics of data fulfills requirements. Examples of characteristics include: completeness, validity, accuracy, consistency, availability, and timeliness. The toolset must be able to apply big data analysis to the information present in the Moodle LMS as well as the learning record store (LRS) present in the learning architecture on the SQQ-89. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. Owned and Operated with no Foreign Influence as defined by DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this contract as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advance phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an AI/ML toolset that mines data from the AN/SQQ-89A (V) 15 sonar system and Moodle LMS. Demonstrate the feasibly of the concept meets the parameters listed in the Description through modeling and analysis. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype of the AI/ML toolset and supporting architecture. Demonstrate at a Government- or company-provided facility that the prototype meets all parameters detailed in the Description. ASW personnel will conduct independent testing in the Fleet. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use through system integration and qualification testing for the toolset prototype developed in Phase II.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop geospatial analytical algorithms to increase speed and alignment to kill chain requirements, in support of a Common Operational Picture (COP). Develop a smart comparative analysis capability to manage data types associated with both geospatial and non-geospatial representations using advanced analytics such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The U.S. Navy requires greater speed of analysis in support of Kill Chain requirements for greater assessment of the environment, positive Identification of threats, and predictive capability to meet growing threat challenges in theater. In order to meet these growing demands, the development of robust technologies for smart geospatial analytics, using modern big data analytics, is needed. Smart geospatial analytics include separation of data and styling information, robust pluggable presentation analytics, and tabular representations. These analytics will feed into a COP for the warfighter, headed by the Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2) system. \r\n\r\nThe MTC2 system is the Navy&#39;s next generation command and control platform providing modernized, robust, secure, integrated, and interoperable network-centric capabilities. MTC2 will replace the legacy planning and decision aid systems and provide a COP in a geospatial display to visualize an operational environment to maintain Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA). \r\n\r\nThe Command and Control Acquisition Program Office, PMW 150, currently fields the Global Command and Control System Maritime (GCCS-M) to support COP representation. The current technology is extremely dated and only provides tracks on a map for viewing with some overlays. Modern, state-of-the-art technologies are providing greater depth and analysis geospatially to consumers. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVWAR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct a study to determine optimum algorithms to perform advanced analytics on geospatial and non-geospatial data to include AI and ML algorithms, and semantic reasoners. Identify the developmental issues and formulate the methodology to include validation concepts which are technically feasible and achievable. The algorithms should be able to ingest geospatial and non-geospatial data to deliver renderings and visually present the data in multiple ways. \r\n\r\nDescribe the technical solution (i.e., software) based on the investigations and technical trade-offs. For the identified technical solution, develop the Phase II Project Plan to include a detailed schedule (in Gantt format), spend plan, performance objectives, and transition plan for the identified Program of Record (PoR). \r\n\r\nNote: The Navy will provide samples of geospatial and non-geospatial data will be provided in Phase I to support an accurate feasibility study.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a software prototype that is able to ingest various data sources and types, including textual and abstract such as Joint Message Handling System (JMHS) for textual and map representations for abstract data types; render geospatially; and evaluate the renderings with algorithms identified in Phase I. The software prototype will be deployable and used for concept validation allowing users to interact under operational condition. The prototype must run in a DEVSECOPS environment, gathering data from the users to feed into requirements for the Program of Record in order to validate concepts. \r\n\r\nProvide insight into visual representations that can assess renderings, formulate understanding and provide the information directly to the user. Investigate themes like Semantics for incorporating attribute and computed values within filter criteria, provide dynamic filtering and linkback to external data sources, and automated drill down and queries based on user history. Provide a visualization environment that aligns with using Esri tools, such as the Commercial Joint Mapping ToolKit (CJMTK), and that is malleable to the warfighter&#39;s needs and learns from behavior. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Conduct further testing of the prototype on experimentation venues, such as Trident Warrior. Integration will be conducted by NIWC Pacific/Atlantic engineers. Initially, the technology will reside in the C2X environment being developed and fielded for test and evaluation. Once completed, integrate the technology into the existing MTC2 Configuration Management (CM) environment for inclusion in the MTC2 normal release update schedule to provide the warfighter the capability to have information analyzed continuously as the representation changes in the COP. The Smart Geospatial Comparative Analysis will provide significant increase in speed of understanding and will allow decisions to be more informed and analyzed to support the Kill Chain process. Commercially, these capabilities can be applied to current Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) to increase capability for industry use.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“NWP 3-56 COMPOSITE WARFARE: MARITIME OPERATIONS AT THE TACTICAL LEVEL OF WAR.” https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a575608.pdf  \r\n\t“NTTP 3-32 Navy Tactics Techniques and Procedures.” www.navybmr.com/study material/NTTP_3-32-1_MOC_(Apr_2013).pdf  \r\n\t“NWP 3-32 MARITIME OPERATIONS AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR.” https://docplayer.net/44980043-Maritime-operations-at-the-operational-level-of-war-nwp-3-32.html   \r\n\t“JP 3-32 COMMAND AND CONTROL FOR JOINT MARITIME OPERATIONS.” https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_32ch1.pdf  \r\n\t“JP 3.0 DOCTRINE FOR JOINT OPERATIONS.” https://docplayer.net/17806770-Joint-publication-3-0-doctrine-for-joint-operations.html \r\n\r\n",

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop digital and/or analog military HF (2 MHz to 30 MHz) wideband interference suppression system to yield significant improvements to SNR (>10 dB) and dynamic range (20+ dB).\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN), AN/USQ-195(v) system provides tactical Radio Frequency (RF) networked communications for the Navy’s afloat, airborne, ashore, and submerged U.S. Navy forces. BFTN currently transports critical Command and Control (C2) data with rates of 19.2 kbps over HF at up to 200 nm and 64 kbps over Ultra High Frequency (UHF) at up to 20 nm. BFTN is undergoing modernization, called BFTN Resilient Command and Control (RC2) System Enhancement, (BRSE), which will result in a significantly more capable system with a new waveform, Robust Communications for Challenging Environments (RoCCE). To provide optimal communications in a challenged environment or when operating with unintentional interference sources, BRSE with RoCCE will require significant effective increase in dynamic range across the full HF band of operation. \r\n\r\nCommunication signal interference sources can be intentional (e.g., “jamming”) with wide variety of forms or unintentional. The latter includes Electromagnetic interference (EMI), Co-channel interference (CCI), Adjacent-channel interference (ACI), Inter-symbol interference (ISI), Inter-carrier interference (ICI), and Common-mode interference (CMI). Communications systems have various methods to deal with interferences such as adaptive equalization, Automatic Gain Control (AGC), analog filters, and advanced digital signal processing techniques. The communications systems, however, are limited in its ability to maintain the full dynamic range when the effects of interference cannot be fully addressed. The loss in dynamic range limits the effective data that can be transmitted in a communications channel. \r\n\r\nRecent advancement in interference suppression and excision have resulted in commercially available stand-alone “appliances” such as iDirect’s Communication Signal Interference Removal (CSIRTM) and the “Auto-tune Filter (AtF)” from Metamagnetics. While each of these systems work well on certain types of interference(s), there is not a single system that can properly categorize the interference(s) and orchestrate the activation of these interference suppression and excision to yield increased dynamic range and improved Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) performance. \r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable for the WISDOM architecture to be realized in software and/or firmware hosted on the BFTN and its successors. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVWAR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define the Wideband Interference Suppression for Dynamic-range OptiMization (WISDOM) architecture that will detect and categorize the interference type(s) and produce a strategy to mitigate the interferences thereof. The architecture should assume that either an analog “tap” or a digital copy (e.g., VITA 49.2 format) of the raw signal received by the radio will be made available to the WISDOM system. \r\n\r\nDuring the Phase I Option period, if exercised, develop the SBIR Phase II Project Plan to include a detailed schedule (in Gantt format), spend plan, performance objectives, and transition plan for BFTN and any other PMW/A 170 identified Program of Record (PoR) to include BRSE, when the program is established.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop the prototype WISDOM for demonstration and validation in BRSE. Conduct Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the WISDOM prototype and commence development of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) system. Conduct Critical Design Review (CDR) prior to building the EDM. \r\n\r\nDevelop lifecycle support strategies and concepts for the WISDOM. \r\n\r\nDevelop SBIR Phase III Project Plan to include a detailed schedule (in Gantt format) and spend plan, performance requirements, and revised transition plan for BRSE and any other PMW/A 170 identified Program of Record (PoR) to include Digital Modular Radio (DMR) and, objectively, with a candidate radio system from PMA/W 101. The name of PMA/W 101 radio system will be provided during Phase II execution period; for proposal purpose, use BRSE as an interim substitute with operation in L band (900 MHz to 2100 MHz). \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Refine and fully develop the Phase II EMD to produce a Production Representative Article (PRA) of the WISDOM and integrate into BRSE. Evaluate the potential to perform integration with other PMW/A 170 identified Program of Record (PoR) to include Digital Modular Radio (DMR) and PMA/W 101 radio system. \r\n\r\nPerform Formal Qualification Tests (FQT) (e.g., field testing, operational assessments) of the PRA WISDOM, preferably embedded in BRSE. \r\n\r\nProvide lifecycle support strategies and concepts for WISDOM potential as embedded in BRSE by developing an amended Life-Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) for BRSE. \r\n\r\nInvestigate the dual use of the developed technologies for commercial applications such as in telecommunications. With 5G, new waveforms must be capable of supporting a greater density of users (e.g., up to a million devices per square kilometer) and higher data throughput (speeds in the Gbps), and provide more efficient utilization of available spectrum. WISDOM can potentially provide the high dynamic range and interference suppression capabilities to meet these needs.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t“Radio jamming.” Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, July 24, 2020.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming  \r\n\t2. “Interference (communication).” Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, July 24, 2020. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference  (communication) \r\n\t“Communication Signal Interference Removal (CSIRTM)” iDirect GOVERNMENT, July 24, 2020. https://idirectgov.com/products/glowlinksignalmanagementandmonitoringproducts/removecsir  \r\n\t“Auto-tune Filter (AtF).” Metamagnetics, July 24, 2020. https://www.mtmgx.com/resources/auto-tune-filter-mm-02c-0320.pdf  \r\n\t“Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy.” U.S. Department of Defense, July 24, 2020. https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf \r\n\r\n",

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Conceive, develop, and demonstrate innovative flow control methodologies that increase inlet system recovery and operability while decreasing inlet-isolator length and combustor-entrance flow distortion without requiring bleed.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The performance of high-speed air-breathing weapons is highly dependent on the inlet performance and operability under a range of inflow Mach numbers, altitudes, and vehicle angles-of-attack and yaw angles. [Ref 1] \r\n\r\nFixed-geometry inlets are desirable due to their mechanical simplicity, but on-design operation is limited to a narrow range of conditions. Off-design modes of inlet operation occurring during acceleration and maneuvers generate highly complex and potentially unstable flowfields that can lead to unpredictable consequences such as inlet unstart. [Refs 2, 3] The unstarted inlet flowfield is characterized by a large separated region and supersonic flow spillage. In general, an unstarted inlet captures less airflow with lower efficiency and higher aerodynamic and thermal loads compared to a started inlet. [Ref 1] \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic aims to develop flow control strategies to improve the inlet flow delivered to scramjet or ramjet combustors. Promising control strategies are not limited to, but may include, mechanical protuberances and fluid injection devices [Ref 4], and their optimal placement in an inlet/isolator system in conjunction with inlet and isolator duct shaping. Figures of merit for flow control strategies include improved flow uniformity at the inlet throat and exit of the isolator, improved inlet flow stability, increased inlet compression efficiency or compression ratio capability, and reduced inlet-isolator system length. Solutions that enable or enhance the performance and operability of a fixed-geometry inlet without bleed are especially attractive. While an unstart detection system is not the focus of this SBIR topic, there is benefit in developing control methodologies that provide the ability to rapidly add pressure margin to the inlet operation if insipient unstart of the inlet is detected. \r\n\r\nRecent improvement in high-fidelity simulations [Refs 5, 6] and optimization methodologies [Ref 7] provide new avenues to design, analyze and optimize novel inlet-isolator control devices. The design of the control devices needs to be guided by numerical simulations and optimization methodologies that includes aerodynamics and thermo-structural considerations. Validation of the analytical and numerical toolsets against wind-tunnel experiments under relevant high-supersonic and hypersonic flight conditions is also needed. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and ONR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a conceptual design for innovative flow control strategies to improve the performance and operability of the inlet-isolator system. The proposed flow control solution(s) shall be developed using suitable computational methodologies to estimate improvements in the relevant performance metrics such as flow uniformity, inlet-isolator length and compression efficiency. The suitability of the computational methodologies for the design and analysis of inlet-isolator control solutions must be demonstrated. Therefore, validation against relevant experimental data for hypersonic inlets and isolators will be a key consideration towards successful phase transition. The analysis must show that the proposed flow control solution(s) enable a significant improvement in the performance metrics outlined above in the Description as the inlet-isolator design is driven toward more compact configurations. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine, optimize and validate the proposed flow control strategies. Mature the computational design and optimization methods. Perform required validation against wind-tunnel experiments under relevant high-supersonic and hypersonic flight conditions to gain confidence in the design methodology and to accurately quantify the improvements to the performance metrics. Perform successful execution of ground tests validating the flow control solution(s), refinement of numerical simulation tools incorporating experimental data, and a detailed plan towards integrating the proposed concept(s) in a Navy relevant flight vehicle in Phase III  all criteria for phase transition. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Seek further maturation of the flow control solution(s), including its manufacturability. Demonstrate the flow control solution(s) on a relevant Navy weapons geometry once a sufficient TRL is achieved. \r\n\r\nIn the near term, this technology is geared toward military applications, but in the longer term, it could be used to enable commercial hypersonic flight. Commercial hypersonic platforms will likely rely on a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) propulsion system that requires inlet operation over a wide range of Mach numbers and low flow distortion for turbine operation. \r\n\r\nCommercialization can include both flow control devices, and the toolset for design, analysis and optimization (devices geometry, placement and integration) of these devices.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tVan Wie, D.M. \"Scramjet Inlets.\" Scramjet Propulsion, AIAA, 2000, pp. 447-511. https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/5.9781600866609.0447.0511  \r\n\tZvegintsev, V.I. \"Gas-dynamic problems in off-design operation of supersonic inlets (review).\" Thermophysics and Aeromechanics, vol. 24, no. 6, 2017, pp. 807-834. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0869864317060014  \r\n\tChang, J.; Li, N; Yu, K.; Bao, W. and Yu, D. \"Recent research progress on unstart mechanism, detection and control of hypersonic inlet.\" Progress in Aerospace Sciences, vol. 89, February 2017, pp. 1-22, 2017. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037604211630080X  \r\n\tValdivia, A.; Yuceil, K.B.; Wagner, J.L.; Clemens, N.T. and Dolling, D.S. \"Control of Supersonic Inlet-Isolator Unstart Using Active and Passive Vortex Generators.\" AIAA Journal, vol. 52, no. 6, 2014. https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J052214  \r\n\tBisek, N.J. \"High-Fidelity Simulations of the HIFiRE-6 Flow Path.\" AIAA 2017-1480, 2016. https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2016-4276  \r\n\tLyubimova, D.A. and Chestnykha, O.A. \"Flow in a High-Velocity Mixed Compression Inlet Studied by the RANS/ILES Method in Different Operation Modes.\" High Temperature, vol. 56, no. 5, 2018, pp. 702–710. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0018151X18040132  \r\n\tKline, H.L. and Alonso, J.J. \"Adjoint of Generalized Outflow-Based Functionals Applied to Hypersonic Inlet Design.\" AIAA Journal, vol. 55, no. 11, 2017. https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/full/10.2514/1.J055863 \r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Machine Learning/AI; General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human Systems\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Increasing complexity in many military roles may require increased cognitive agility in areas of situation assessment, strategic and tactical decision making and better skill interpreting information in order to evaluate the need for a change in plans. Significant research has shown that it takes years and many repetitions for an individual to gain the skills. This cultivated knowledge and decision-making capability is necessary to develop expertise in any of these areas. However, recent research suggests that skill acquisition can be accelerated. This proposal explores a learning model that may help military personnel develop the necessary capabilities much faster using virtual environments with granular feedback, which have been shown to accelerate learning.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Significant research has shown that it takes years and many repetitions for an individual to gain the skills, knowledge, and decision-making capability necessary to become an expert in a field. Recent research suggests that this requirement can be accelerated. Three questions come to mind: 1. Given recent research on accelerated learning in specific domains [Ref 1], can expertise that traditionally required years to master take only days or weeks to achieve? 2. What are the implications for expertise in broad cognitive capabilities such as situation assessment, strategic thinking, and tactical or general cognitive agility? Understanding these questions is crucial and time sensitive since the world is maneuvering and innovating faster across key domains including technology, military, politics, business, and education. \r\n\r\nThe interest in accelerating the mastery of expertise has a long history [Refs 2, 3]. Schneider et al [Ref 4] posited that those considered experts are qualitatively different from novices and journeymen. The process of becoming an expert takes years. He claimed that training the traditional route would not enable novices and journeymen to achieve the highest levels of expertise. Rather than traditional methods of training, the instructional designer and trainer must plumb the depths of learning strategies of those who would be experts. However, recently there has not been interest in this area of research, as evident by the dates of the publications referenced. It is time to revisit this area with the research described in this SBIR topic. This research could support an updated model of expertise acquisition that would advance training environments.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for an advanced training environment in the form of a multi-player game. Identify learning design features that encourage rapid learning. Base the architecture of the game on a model of accelerated learning as applied to military personnel. Ensure that the intent of the game should be to train combat personnel to operate successfully in urban battle settings. Produce and submit a final report that is a design document that describes the multi-player game features and includes a Phase II plan that describes a technical approach to achieve the desired result/product; and includes key component technological milestones such as the proposed experimental design to validate the resulting accelerated learning algorithms within the context of relevant operational tasks and environments.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Apply the instructional design accelerated learning principles in Phase I to a proof-of-concept technical feasibility demonstration. Empirically test the learning model by applying it via a virtual learning environment to a complex military problem. The virtual learning environment should be game based and multiplayer. Junior officers and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) will be the target users for the proof of concept. Validate training scenarios. Develop a data collection plan that includes the number and type of subjects; control condition, assessment instruments, and analysis plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the resulting technology for use in operational environments. Private Sector Commercial Potential: This SBIR topic would provide much needed theory, principles and technology to help the Navy/USMC introduce accelerated learning principles to both instructional designers, instructional personnel, and military personnel. The principles and technology would have broad applicability to learning endeavors within the military and to civilian training interests, particularly commercial game developers.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHoffman, R.R., Ward, P., Feltovich, P.J., DiBello, L., Fiore, S.M. and Andrews, D. “Accelerating Learning and Expertise: Concepts and Applications.” Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting Proceedings 54(4), September 2010, pp. 399-402. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288495066_Accelerated_Learning_Prospects_Issues_and_Applications  \r\n\tChi, M., Feltovich, P., and Glaser, R. “Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and novices.” Cognitive Science, 5(2), 1981, pp. 121-152. https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a100301.pdf  \r\n\tChi, M.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop an automated tool suite to formally verify correctness of software defined networks (SDNs), from programming to network implementations, subject to Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) standards and protocols.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Cybersecurity vulnerabilities commonly arise from flawed implementations. To minimize attack surfaces while harnessing the full power of Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio networks, innovative solutions that identify flaws and formally verify correctness of underlying SDNs are required. Furthermore, automation will relieve the burden on operators who often validate code empirically, and will facilitate rapid, secure reconfigurability of SDNs. This SBIR topic addresses the challenge of automating formal verification of code and network correctness, which has thus far limited such technology to Industrial Control System applications. The innovative solution sought is an automated tool suite that identifies SDN programming flaws or malicious content and employs formal techniques to prove correctness of network implementations.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept framework for an automated tool suite that will formally verify correctness of complete SDN implementations, ensuring compliance with any applicable NIST and ISO/IEC 27000 standards. Evaluate the type and source of vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited as a result of faulty SDN implementations from programming flaws and malicious code to the actual network instantiation, considering both accidental and malicious events. Provide measures of effectiveness for such tools, as well as attainable performance characteristics. The framework will need to be flexible and extensible across a set of hardware systems, with a proposed design for the hardware and software architectures that will be incorporated into 5G-enabled cyber physical systems for assured cyber resilience. The design should include a summary of any computing and power requirements for administering these cybersecurity tools. The feasibility of the concept will be established through modeling and simulation. Include, in a Phase II plan, the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build prototype tools in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Fully develop, verify, and validate prototype automated tools that formally verify correctness of complete SDN implementations subject to applicable standards and protocols (e.g., 5G NR, NIST, and ISO/IEC 27000) for evaluation. Design the prototype tool suite to provide formal verification of code and network functionality prior to instantiation. Demonstrate the design performance through modeling and physical testing over a range of scenarios devised to test network vulnerabilities with and without the cyber resilient layer in place. Use evaluation criteria and results to refine the prototype tool suite into an initial design that can be deployed in relevant and/or operational environment settings, and that support mission requirements in the cyber domain, which ultimately ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Develop a Phase III plan to transition the technology to a system that can be acquired by the Navy.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support Navy system integration of the cybersecurity framework, hardware and software, employing any lessons learned from the Phase II evaluation. Incorporate the automated tool suite into security assessments that support both any existing and future SDN implementations. This integration will also include validation testing and demonstration on a representative 5G-networked system. The automated tool suite developed in this SBIR effort would support formal verification of correct SDN applications in 5G networks used by industry, infrastructure, energy, health care, and other applications where cyber attacks due to flawed implementation may be expected to interfere with the integrity or availability of data and analysis from 5G-enabled cyber physical systems.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBall, T., Bjørner, N., Gember, A., Itzhaky, S.

"topic_title": "Low Cost, Single Use Precision Aiming Device for Explosive Ordnance Disposal Disrupters and Tools",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-084",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Autonomy; General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments; Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate a low cost, single shot, precision aiming device designed to fit onto multiple Explosive Ordnance Disposal Disrupters.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) disrupters and tools are used to remotely open or render safe a suspect item or improvised explosive device (IED). Current precision aiming systems utilize reusable lasers that are expensive and under certain recoil forces/conditions exhibit limited survivability. The EOD community has identified the need for a low cost, lightweight, precise aiming capability for one-time use (single shot) on a variety of disrupters and tools. The aiming capability should aim and hit a variety targets with different surfaces at a standoff distance threshold of 25 feet and objective of 50 feet. It should have an aim-spot accuracy of approximately 0.955 inches (the diameter of a U.S. quarter). The capability should be able to wrap around multiple disrupter/tool barrels with a threshold requirement of 1\"-2\" diameters and an objective requirement of 1\"-6\" diameters. Separate configurations to achieve the range of 1\"-6\" diameters is acceptable. Battery operation of the device is acceptable. A concept of employment that provides minimal setup time with no tools is preferred along with the smallest, lightest weight configuration. Operators should be able to see the aim-spot in daylight with their eyes and remotely through a camera interface. At night, the capability should be infrared (IR) or night vision compatible. Examples of evaluations and descriptions of some DoD, local and state bomb squad disrupters and laser aiming devices are provided in References (1) and (2). \r\n\r\nThe innovation of this research is in the development of a precision aiming device that is one use, lightweight, low cost and capable of easy operator set up on multiple diameter disrupters and tools. Novel laser or non-laser solutions are acceptable.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define, develop and possibly validate the initial design concept for a low cost, single shot, precision aiming device. If requested, the Government can provide an inert 155mm round fuze as an exemplar validation target. Provide a final report of the initial work and results for the single shot precision aiming device, the concept of employment for the various disrupter sizes, a device cost forecast and Phase II implementation plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Produce prototype hardware. Develop, demonstrate and validate the design. The Government can provide test opportunities on actual systems if the validation work is mature enough to enable a viable test.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the device to the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance program. Manufacture a sufficient number of devices to support a statistically relevant field test validation and verification using a variety of disrupters. Additionally, the device could transition to use by state and local bomb squads.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tU.S. Department of Homeland Security. “Explosive Ordnance Disposal Disrupters.” System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER), June 2012. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/EODDisrupters-SUM_0612-508.pdf \r\n\tU.S. Department of Homeland Security. “Laser Aiming Devices for EOD Disrupters.” System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER), May 2013. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/LaserAimingDevices-SUM_0513-508_0.pdf\r\n\r\n",

"topic_title": "Developing Alloy Compositions Conducive to Additive Manufacturing",
"branch": "Navy",
"topic_number": "N211-085",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Machine Learning/AI; General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms; Ground / Sea Vehicles; Materials / Processes\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop alloy compositions that enable additive manufacturing (AM) processes to produce properties that are not currently achievable such as materials with a preferred crystallographic orientation, dispersion-forming alloys that can either form the dispersion during AM or after AM through heat treatment. Alloy compositions should reduce defects in components, thus promoting them to be more resistant to fatigue, with potential increases in strength.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Additive work is being done on current cast and wrought alloy compositions trying to achieve original alloy properties. Achieving such properties is difficult because of the varying solidification conditions inherent in different AM processes and part designs. AM alloys have a complex thermal history involving directional heat build-up and repeated melting and rapid solidification. AM usually results in a finer microstructure than conventional processing which gives the AM material better fatigue properties, but debited creep properties. Modifying alloy compositions to take advantage of AM solidification variables could take advantage of AM to improve alloy properties. The interaction of alloying elements is recognized in promoting desirable microstructural phases and solid-solution effects for development of properties. The use of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) should relate AM processability with alloy chemistry in order to develop models that are able to predict alloy chemistry that minimizes defects while maintaining base alloy properties. This could be done by linking materials data sets, modeling, and AM variables in a machine learning framework to achieve properties. The condition under which solidification takes place determines the structural features that affect the physical and mechanical properties of an alloy. Melting and solidification are generally well-understood during casting processes, but melting and solidification profiles, effect of contamination, and alloy chemistry control during cyclic AM processing, particularly for complex and thicker components, are also not well characterized.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Explore the literature to determine the relationship of wrought alloys chemical compositions and the chemistries of its cast alloy corollaries, understand the underlining reasons for the different chemistries to enable an alloy to be similar by each process. The company should select an AM process which has a good understanding of the heat transfer, solidification variables, and factors which cause defects. Focus on IN 718 or Alloy 230 with the goal of producing properties equivalent to or greater than achieved by the wrought alloy. Develop conceptual models/algorithms that link alloy chemistry to AM processes and resulting alloy microstructure and subsequent mechanical properties. Company needs to show that alloy chemistry models can consistently predict the alloy physical and mechanical properties for the AM process selected. Consider powder chemistry and size distribution. Analysis of the defects is suggested to be done by non-destructive processes such as optical tomography, in-situ thermographic analysis, ultrasonic monitoring or x-ray tomography. ICME should link to AM process parameters with defect frequency and distribution in the component design, employ and prove feasibility of an approach for a metal AM method. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based upon Phase I effort, apply ICME tools to optimize metal AM processing and to predict design and processing parameter limits for a more complex component. Consider computational models and relevant databases. Since most AM metal processes are layer--by-layer, work need to model the change in heat transfer as the layers are added to previous layers in an effort to minimize microstructural changes within the component. Determine relative sensitivity of different chemistry variables within a property model; and determine which variable is “most important” in controlling property value. Work to optimize the alloy chemistry/processing/property model by selecting another nickel-base alloy or an iron-based alloy to explore an alloy family. Collaborate with a powder manufacturer for powder size distributions for AM systems. Ensure that the program provides a means for capturing, sharing, and transforming materials data into a structured format that is amenable to transformation to other formats for use by ICME and other computational programs, modeling, and simulation methods. Demonstrate the functionality of this framework.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The AM process and alloy chemistries that are suited specifically for AM processes offers the opportunity of conformal, and unique design not possible with more conventional fabrication processes. Proven AM process optimization leading to a minimization of process - and materials - derived defects would improve acceptance of AM for producing component for the Navy and for private industry. The use of AM could lead to more innovative designs capable of more efficiently removing heat because such designs could eliminate or severely reduce joints. AM processing of components that are qualified for Navy use could also be applied to commercial use. The use of AM could lead to more innovative designs capable meet ever-increasing demands on components for the Navy as such designs could eliminate or severely reduce joints. AM processing of components that are qualified for Navy use could also be applied to commercial use more quickly. Engage with the Government and/or public, commercial, company, or professional technical societies that retain materials databases. Interface with a software company that promotes and delivers materials computational programs to explore and develop an integration pathway for the database discriminating program with their software. The outcome of this technology development program will be a commercial suite of informatics-derived tools that can be able to reliably analyze and discriminate various sources of materials databases to optimize the capability for materials prediction. Transition the material production methodology to a suitable industrial material producer. The ICME code needs to be transitioned to the commercial entity for potential incorporation of a more comprehensive ICME code. Commercialize the alloys for use in DoD and commercial markets.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMitchell, A. \"Melting, Casting, and Forging Problems in Titanium Alloys.\" Materials Science and Engineering A, v.243(1-2), 1998, pp.257-262. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921509397008101  \r\n\tJablonki, P.D., Hawk, J.A., Cowen, C.J.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): 5G; Microelectronics\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics; Materials / Processes; Sensors\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Demonstrate robust N-polar Gallium Nitride (GaN) E-band low noise amplifiers (LNAs) with < 1 dB at 30 GHz. The device and LNAs must use a native growth N-polar epitaxy process on a low-cost substrate that can be scaled to diameters of 150 mm and above.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: N-polar GaN has demonstrated breakthrough high-power density performance in the W-band, and matched or exceeded power performance of traditional Ga-polar GaN at lower frequencies including X and Ka-band. GaN transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) today are expensive, with a significant portion of the cost coming from the Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrates and their smaller diameters (150 mm substrates will lower MMIC cost by 6X at 200 mm. Alternate substrates will be lower thermal conductivity and/or increased microwave loss, the impact of which should be considered. A single epitaxial structure will lead to a 50% reduction in integration cost of an LNA, Power Amplifier (PA) and transmit / receive (TR) switch. Tradeoffs in performance of individual circuits is anticipated in order to meet the topic objectives in a single device epilayer structure. Examples for the current state of the art for Ga-polar GaN HEMT on SiC follow; HRL’s T4A process provides excellent NFmin below 1 dB at 30 GHz and approximately 0.5 W/mm power density. Ga-polar GaN-on-SiC HEMT&#39;s data at 94 GHz at 2 W/mm and 22% power-added-efficiency (PAE) has been reported. Nitrogen polar (N-polar) GaN HEMTs, at 94 GHz, have demonstrated ~9 W/mm at 28% PAE on SiC and 4 W/mm, 30% PAE on Sapphire. N-polar GaN LNA&#39;s have not been reported. Availability of N-polar GaN device materials in substrate diameters from 100-200 mm is being established through DoD investment in technology transition and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design and fabricate a low noise N-polar GaN HEMT device with noise figure (NF) min 4 W/mm and >25% PAE and transmit/receive (T/R) switches. Characterize noise and S-parameters and extract noise and linear models. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine the design of and fabricate a prototype E-band 81-86 GHz LNA demonstrating 15 dB gain. Characterize the noise and small-signal performance. On the same wafer, fabricate split path, double throw (SPDT) T/R switches and characterize their performance at small and large signal level under continuous wave (CW) conditions. Based on the measured performance, survey and identify E-band transceiver applications for the Phase II results.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There are many emerging transceiver applications for both DoD and commercial systems for E-band. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has established that portions of E-band are available in the U.S. for high density, high data rate wireless services that will enable point-to-point communications, SATCOM, and 5G services. The International Telecommunication Union permits several bands for radio and satellite operations. For example, SpaceX has applied to use portions of E-band in their Starlink Gen2 satellite constellation. E-band will enable new high-resolution imaging and surveillance sensors for DoD systems and commercial applications such autonomous vehicles. In Phase III, transition and demonstrate the N-polar device fabrication to a full wafer fabrication at wafer diameters > 150 mm. Refine the designs developed in the Phase II. Based on the phase II application survey for an E-band transceiver application, develop the TR module specifications to satisfy this application. Design and fabricate a prototype integrated TR module and package into a waveguide housing with all bias and control signals integrated. Characterize under relevant operating conditions. Based on the results, further refine the designs.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWienecke, S. et al. “N-Polar Deep Recess MISHEMTs with Record 2.9 W/mm at 94 GHz.” IEEE Electron Device Lett., vol. 37, no. 6, June 2016. doi: 10.1109/LED.2016.2556717 \r\n\tRomanczyk, B. et al. “mm-Wave N-polar GaN MISHEMT with a self-aligned recessed gate exhibiting record 4.2 W/mm at 94 GHz on Sapphire.” 2016 74th Annual Device Research Conference (DRC), Jun. 2016, vol. 2016, pp. 1–2. doi: 10.1109/DRC.2016.7548464 \r\n\tRomanczyk, B. et al. “Demonstration of Constant 8 W/mm Power Density at 10, 30, and 94 GHz in State-of-the-Art Millimeter-Wave N-Polar GaN MISHEMTs.” IEEE Trans.

"topic_number": "N211-087",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics; Ground / Sea Vehicles; Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate compact power electronics modules capable of supporting power combining of solid state High Power Microwave (HPM) sources. Develop bond wireless technology to enable ultra-high voltage silicon carbide metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (SiC MOSFET), insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), Thyristor, and diode modules capable of higher pulse repetition rate operation for burst mode operation. Develop specialized test beds that have the ability to characterize the maximum di/dt and dv/dt limitations of SiC devices while determining the safe operating area (SOA) of the modules. Advance and verify switch characteristics such as fast rise time and low impedance to be able to drive specific HPM sources. Develop a compact, less than 1 ft^3, packaged switch module capable of delivering 50-100 kV outputs that also has the ability to be combined to scale driver power. Demonstrate low jitter module operations to facilitate phased element design. This phased multi module system design will show the ability for scalable power and subsequent beam steering operations.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Commercial grade SiC power electronic devices are available in the market; however, high voltage (HV) SiC devices have not been developed, tested, or packaged specifically for HPM applications. Research grade SiC MOSFET and IGBT dies have been packaged individually, but the maximum di/dt and narrow pulse capability have not been determined. In addition, HV IGBTs have not been packaged in modules. Ultra-high voltage SiC MOSFET, IGBT, Thyristor, and diode modules can be developed for narrow pulse fast rise time applications, while requiring unique drivers to optimize performance. The power density, long term reliability, efficiency, and control of directed energy systems can be improved through the utilization of novel SiC device modules. The fabrication of SiC has rapidly advanced in recent years with defect density and average carrier lifetime vastly improved, enabling stable and reliable operation. However, the device packaging has not been optimized for pulsed power switching that has very short times while being very high in voltage. The bond wires are a known failure point during high current switching that will need to be addressed. \r\n\r\nSimulations show that SiC MOSFETs can be capable of up to 15 kV while SiC IGBTs are suitable from 15 kV to 35 kV, while higher voltages from 35 kV to 50 kV SiC gate turn off (GTO) Thyristors are the optimal choice [Ref 1]. Cree-Wolfspeed has developed a 15 kV SiC MOSFET and a 24 kV SiC IGBT as of 2016, though they are not in their standard product inventory [Refs 2, 3]. The rise-time of the MOSFET was 102 ns for an 8 kV, 28 A pulse while the IGBT had a switching speed of 46 kV/µs. Photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS) SiC have been developed to show switching voltages of 50 kV in experimental setups for a radial topology [Ref 4]. Behlke has developed HV solid state switching modules capable of switching 200 kV with a 1.6 kA current and a rise-time of 300 ns (HTS 2000-160). Behlke also has Thyristors capable of switching 150 kV with a 10 kA current and a rise-time of 35 µs (HTS 1500-1000-SCR).\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conceptualize, design, and model key elements for an innovative, all solid-state power modulator capable of a threshold 50 kV and objective 100 kV at pulse repetition rates of tens of kHz or higher. The design should establish realizable technological solutions for a module capable of driving various HPM sources that have certain requirements in rise-time and impedances. \r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n\r\n• The technical solution should have a minimum pulse repetition rate on the order of tens of kHz or higher. \r\n\r\n• The conceptual design should focus on rise times of 10’s of ns, <100 Ohm impedance, and jitter <1 ns to be able to drive specific HPM sources and accurately phase multiple modules.\r\n\r\n• The proposed design should be an 80% complete solution and include all auxiliary systems associated with the control system for the power electronics, power buffer/energy magazines and thermal management.\r\n\r\n• The design should include circuit modeling and analysis of the HV driver.\r\n\r\n• The proposed brassboard system should be designed for both laboratory and limited open air testing with sufficient ruggedization to transport the hardware to test sites.\r\n\r\nPerform additional modeling and simulation to determine predicted efficiency, prime power draw, and thermal management requirements. Provide an overview of the current state of the art for each of the key prototype elements along with manufacturer information, focusing on the solid state components required for this application, packaging and power density. Provide a cost analysis as well as material development to ascertain critical needs not yet fully developed or readily available given current technology. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine the design of the proposed technology. Complete procurement, integration, assembly, and testing of a proof-of-concept brassboard prototype leveraging the Phase I effort. Requirements: \r\n\r\n• The Phase II brassboard prototype will be capable of greater than 50 kV and a rep rate above 50 kHz, while being able to support low jitter (<1ns), fast rise-time (10’s of ns) operations.\r\n\r\n• The brassboard system should be capable of operating in a laboratory environment, such as an anechoic chamber or Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) test cell.\r\n\r\n• This brassboard prototype must demonstrate a clear path forward to a full scale concept demonstrator based on the selected technology.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: A successful project will also showcase the ability of the technology to match evolving needs of commercial markets such as medical pulse power and sterilization. Recent progress in medical pulse power research, utilizing high voltage short pulses to increase immunology efficacy has driven the need of a low jitter, fast rep-rate, low impedance, solid-state HV pulse generator. Several medical areas benefiting from these HV modulators include wound healing, cancer treatment, and gene transfer. Various commercial markets ranging from environmental, sanitization, and food processing has also shown increased efficacy when utilizing short, high voltage pulses. These applications can be realized by the development of a reliable, long lifetime, solid-state HV modulator. \r\n\r\nWithin DOD, we seek to apply the knowledge gained during Phase I and II to further build, refine and demonstrate a full scale prototype device capable of transmitting an arbitrary waveform at power levels exceeding 10 MW and a rep-rate on the order of tens of kHz or more. To allow this, it is suggested to ensure that the prototype represents a complete power modulator with controls, thermal management, energy magazine or prime power buffer; and is ruggedized for, at a minimum, testing in an outdoor environment and be environmentally enclosed; and includes at least 2 or more modules that shows active control over phasing and power combining.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tJohannesson, D., Nawaz, M., Jacobs, K., Norrga, S. and Nee, H. \"Potential of ultra-high voltage silicon carbide semiconductor devices.\" 2016 IEEE 4th Workshop on Wide Bandgap Power Devices and Applications (WiPDA), Fayetteville, AR, 2016, pp. 253-258. doi: 10.1109/WiPDA.2016.7799948. \r\n\tPassmore, B. and O’Neal, C. “High-voltage SiC power modules for 10-25 kV applications.” Power Electronics Europe, no. 1, 2016, pp. 22-24. https://www.wolfspeed.com/downloads /dl/file/id/854/product/0/high_voltage_sic_power_modules_for_10_25_kv_applications.pdf  \r\n\tBrunt, E.V. et al. \"22 kV, 1 cm2, 4H-SiC n-IGBTs with improved conductivity modulation.\" 2014 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices & IC&#39;s (ISPSD), Waikoloa, HI, 2014, pp. 358-361. doi: 10.1109/ISPSD.2014.6856050. \r\n\tHettler, C., Sullivan, W.W., Dickens, J. and Neuber, A. \"Performance and optimization of a 50 kV silicon carbide photoconductive semiconductor switch for pulsed power applications.\" 2012 IEEE International Power Modulator and High Voltage Conference (IPMHVC), San Diego, CA, 2012, pp. 70-72. doi: 10.1109/IPMHVC.2012.6518682. \r\n\tBenford, J., Swegle, J. and Schamiloglu, E. “High Power Microwaves.” Copyright 2007.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Battlespace Environments; Information Systems; Sensors\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop and demonstrate an airborne capability to measure with fidelity the temperature of the ocean across the upper part of the water column, where it is most variable - and therefore produces the greatest effects upon acoustic propagation. Fidelity will necessarily vary as a function of platform altitude, platform velocity, and atmospheric properties. Validate an understanding of the limits of performance and a hierarchical understanding of the underlying causes of limited performance.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Active optical (LIDAR) techniques exist to measure sound speed in liquids remotely by spectrally resolving the Brillouin component of the backscatter. In contrast to Raman LIDAR techniques, which require assumptions about salinity to derive sound speed, Brillouin LIDAR techniques are capable of inferring sound speed directly. However, demonstrations of the Brillouin technique have so far been confined to the laboratory, and are not routinely employed in the field, nor do commercial sensors exist. \r\n\r\nAny approach offered shall, at a minimum, enable the measurement of sound speed profiles in seawater remotely, along a line of sight, day and night, with an accuracy of at least 1.5 m/s, and an along-beam resolution of 5 m or better, to a total range in mesotrophic waters of at least 40 m. The approach must not depend on assumptions about salinity or temperature of the water, nor the amount of suspended particulates, and must be fieldable and hands-free. \r\n\r\nThis effort is focused on exploring novel techniques that exploit the Brillouin scatter process to directly measure sound speed in water. Any approach must show early promise for enabling routine operational measurements from seagoing and/or airborne vessels, and must not depend on regular human intervention to operate correctly. Candidate techniques include, but are not limited to, use of stable optical filters, spectrometers, or combinations thereof, to spectrally resolve Brillouin backscatter. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and ONR in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept to obtain profiles of sound speed through seawater that is compatible with deployment on seagoing vessels. The concept shall include a high level description of the hardware and associated algorithms, description of a water tank demonstration, and corresponding performance simulations. All assumptions made for the performance modeling shall be clearly stated. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Produce a laboratory water tank demonstration based on the Phase I work. The prototype shall demonstrate the form and function of the critical sensor elements as accurately as possible. The prototype shall be capable of validating key sensor performance parameters; laboratory validations shall be conducted and documented by the awardee using the prototype hardware. Sensor shall be delivered to the Government for testing. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Interface with stakeholders in both ocean modelling and tactical communities to identify platform (ship, submersible, etc.) and performance needs, then scale and engineer the system appropriately to those needs.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHostetler, Chris A., Behrenfeld, Michael J., Hu, Yongxiang, Hair, Johnathan W. and Schulien, Jennifer A. \"Spaceborne LIDAR in the study of marine systems.\" Annual review of marine science 10, 2018, pp. 121-147. https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-marine-121916-063335  \r\n\tEnglert, Christoph R., Harlander, John M., Brown, Charles M., Marr, Kenneth D., Miller, Ian J., Stump, J.

"topic_number": "N211-090",
"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Directed energy; General Warfighting Requirements\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Ground / Sea Vehicles\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a low-cost, high-speed sensor and instrumentation to measure refrigerant quality in an electronics cooling system.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Two-phase cooling systems using pumped refrigerant loops are being developed to remove heat from high-powered electronic systems. These thermal systems would benefit from monitoring the relative mass fractions of liquid and vapor phases (quality) in a saturated mixture, for future system optimization and assurance of safe operation in harsh environmental and transient operational conditions. Capacitance and impedance techniques can be used for volume averaged void fraction measurements, but these techniques are limited by their relatively low spatial resolution and the accuracy of the reconstructed image, and are not readily available to utilize for platform applications. Laboratory experiments rely on complex, expensive instrumentation to measure quality, such as image analysis or liquid-vapor separators. Measurement of the spatial and temporal variation of quality also allow for a characterization of flow regimes, which can be used to predict heat transfer performance. Such techniques are not easily translated to fielded systems that may require hundreds of such sensors operating at frequencies greater than 100 Hz for integration into the control system. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this SBIR topic is to design and fabricate a non-invasive, high-speed instrument to measure refrigerant quality in an operational, military electronics cooling system. The electronics cooling system shall be able to use the instrument measured refrigerant quality as a controls parameters. The instrument shall be able to assess vapor qualities as high as 0.80 and operate under dynamic platform motion as defined by DOD-STD-1399/301a. The instrumentation shall be waterproof and vibration resistant and should be able to interface with control systems through standard software communication protocols such as Modbus.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design for an instrument to measure refrigerant vapor quality. The sensor should not exceed 25 lbs per-unit-weight and 1 cu ft volume size. Validate design performance through analytical modeling and subscale demonstration for vapor qualities up to 0.80. Ensure that the system maintains proper operation when subjected to ship motion dynamics (DOD-STD-1399/301a). Perform rough manufacturing cost analysis. Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Refine Phase I design and fabricate prototype instrument, including software interface to commercial platforms. Ensure that the system is capable of monitoring at least 10 independent sensors. Demonstrate operation in a pumped refrigerant loop using R134a over vapor qualities of 0.0 to 0.80. Perform more detailed manufacturing cost analysis.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop final design and manufacturing plans using the knowledge gained during Phases I and II in order to support transition of system to Navy platforms. Ensure that the final system meets Navy unique requirements, e.g., shock, vibration, and electromagnetic interference (EMI). The development of refrigerant quality sensors capable of operating under dynamic motion associated with shipboard installation has commercial applications that include cooling of electric vehicles and commercial vessels.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCaniere, H., T&#39;Joen, C., Willockx, A. and De Paepe, M. “Capacitance signal analysis of horizontal two-phase flow in a small tube.” Exp.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a capability for high resolution real-time simulation of targets and cluttered backgrounds for active imaging Radio Frequency (RF) sensors during hardware-in-the-loop testing.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Government hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) facilities are used to evaluate closed-loop processes associated with weapon guidance and control. To close the guidance loop, the facility must realistically represent the input to sensors used to recognize, track, and guide to the target. In order to develop and test increasingly advanced radar seeker capabilities, there is a need to increase the resolution of the simulated RF scenes. One method of accomplishing this is by increasing the number of RF scatterers used to represent the RF scene. Imaging RF sensors using synthetic aperture radar technology might need on the order of one million scatters to represent the complexity targets and background characteristics. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic focuses on the algorithmic processes and computing architecture required to generate high resolution scenes in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop test environment. The modified return pulses must be calculated and generated based on a dynamic engagement where the engagement parameters and radar state for each update are changing in real time. The scene processing will receive updated state information from the engagement simulation computer at a specified update rate (i.e., 1200Hz). An appropriate computing architecture must be found, possibly graphics processing unit (GPU), field-programmable gate array (FPGA), RFSOC, central processing unit (CPU), digital signal processor (DSP), or combinations of the aforementioned, that provides required increases in processing speed to modify the returned pulse based on target and background interactions. Algorithmic techniques must be defined and implemented to capture the effect of scattered energy in a complex scene (e.g., method of moments, ray tracing) compatible with the real time HWIL test environment. Urban and natural terrains will be bounded pretest, but may extend for considerable distances if used to obtain navigation reference information or if considerable target uncertainty exists. \r\n\r\nThere are two key steps in creating the return pulse waveform: 1) scene generation that has to occur once per pulse repetition interval (PRI) based on engagement kinematics, and 2) waveform generation that involves convolving the scene with the digitized transmit pulse which has to occur within the time of flight from the radar to the target area and back (t = 2d/c). The goal is the equivalent of 1 million scatterers in the target scene at 10,000 Hz. Note that the use of discrete scatterers to modulate the pulse is used as an example, with understanding that there may be other methods of capturing the effect of complex backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe developed technology will be transitioned to Navy and other DoD facilities. For proof of concept and evaluation, the processing architecture must be baselined to communicate/interface with the existing 6DOF engagement systems and the Navy system located in existing facilities. A requirements assessment during Phase I will determine whether any additional interface compatibility is required for other government systems. Designs with modularity that allow for incremental increase in fidelity are possibly of benefit to accommodate budgetary and programmatic constraints. The Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. If needed, data of the same level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I work. The Phase II effort will likely require secure access, and SSP will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Bound the problem and develop a processing architecture that can meet the RF scene complexity/resolution goal. Attention will be paid to the best processing architecture or combinations of architectures that best meets the requirements. Document the design and trades made to reach the conclusions. Digital simulations should be executed to demonstrate the capabilities of the design. The software design should use best practices to provide for readability, modification, scalability, reproducibility and support constant evolution into new hardware (H/W) to allow for protection from obsolescence. A facility survey will be performed to determine compatibility requirements with relevant RF target simulators. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype RF target simulation processing system and deliver for testing and evaluation as a component of the Navy Dynetics system. The prototype shall be based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). The prototype shall be software (S/W) that runs on the existing Navy H/W, H/W that interfaces with the existing RF simulator hardware, or shall be some combination of both. Work with Navy subject matter experts, which may include Government personnel and contractors, to develop and demonstrate the prototype with the Navy RF simulator. Fully document the prototype design H/W, S/W and interfaces. The Government will provide the RF sensor and also develop a scenario or group of scenarios to act as test cases to be use to evaluate new scene generation capabilities. Collaborate with the Government to analyze the results of the test cases. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to DoD use. In addition to the Navy system, other DoD and DoD contractor facilities will be identified as potential recipients of this technology. The final product shall be a processing architecture that can generate high resolution RF scenes that are calculated in real-time and interface with DoD facilities. The system needs to be fully supportable and maintainable by the government. The system needs to be adaptable and expandable as technology improves. \r\n\r\nThis technology can be used to support non-DoD industries such as automotive radar, survey and mapping equipment manufacturing, and simulation for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) satellite radar manufacturers.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBalz, T. “Real-time SAR simulation of complex scenes using programmable graphics processing units.” Proceedings of the ISPRS TCVII Mid-term Symposium, July 2006. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200148298_Realtime_SAR_simulation_of_complex_scenes_using_programmable_Graphics_Processing_Units  \r\n\tZhang, F.C. “A GPU Based Memory Optimized Parallel Method For FFT Implementation.”23 July 2017. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07263.pdf \r\n\r\n",

Current hypersonic systems have a Thermal Protection System (TPS) that includes expensive materials that are also difficult and time consuming to produce. Understanding the performance of these materials during developmental flight testing is key to providing an optimized system solution that can ultimately meet performance requirements while also reducing the cost to the US Government. \r\n\r\nCritical TPS performance metrics that are required for full missile system performance in a flight test event include TPS surface temperatures and ablation data on critical components such as the nosecone, aeroshell and leading edges. Currently, sensor technology exists with the ability to capture critical TPS material information, including surface temperatures and ablation data, during laboratory testing. However, this sensor technology in its current state is not able to measure these parameters on a missile traveling at hypersonic speeds. The U.S. Navy is interested in a sensor that can be integrated onboard a missile system to measure real-time surface temperature and ablation material response during hypersonic flight tests. \r\n\r\nThis technology must be able to detect and measure parameters of the surface materials on the TPS from inside the missile. The design of the sensor will be required to have precise technical functionality as well as overcome the mechanical packaging and electrical integration challenges associated with an onboard missile system. This technology will enable critical test performance metrics to be captured that are not currently captured. The data collected from this enabling technology is critical to TPS modeling and simulation to further understand the capability of the current TPS design as well as future designs. This technology supports advanced system performance assessments such as understanding the maximum range capability of the current system. Also, this technology is key to reducing the robustness of the current TPS design in favor of an optimized design that focuses on system weight savings while maintaining performance requirements. \r\n\r\nThe Phase II effort will likely require secure access, and SSP will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access.

Identify ablation sensor technology and demonstrate bread-board ability to resolve length change on representative material. Perform subsystem design and analysis addressing material and environmental requirements for the sensor. Specific requirements for ablator material and measurement implementation for the prototype design must be understood. Demonstrate a concept that can maintain mechanical and electrical packaging requirements given by the Government upon contract award during the Phase I period of performance.

As coherent light passes through many layers of atmospheric turbulence, the wavefront is distorted in a way so that a traditionally formed image is blurred with a space-variant distortion. Emerging methods in digital holographic (DH) imaged together with the fusion of advanced AI methods with advanced physics-based sensor models offer the possibility of recovering a model of the propagation distortion, so that the wavefront can be corrected. However, in order for these technologies to have impact, novel algorithms and integrated software/hardware systems must be created and implemented that allow for real-time closed-loop recovery and correction of optical wavefront distortion from a single-shot of data. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic looks to develop a volumetric wavefront sensing (WFS) computational pipeline that meets the latency, throughput, and accuracy requirements required for integration into a real-time imaging (i.e., Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)) or directed energy system. The end goal of this SBIR topic is to design (Phase I) and demonstrate (Phase II) a volumetric WFS prototype computational pipeline that can operate in the presence of extended non-cooperative targets and distributed-volume aberrations. The Phase I effort shall develop the integrated theoretical algorithms, software, and computational hardware systems required to meet the demanding throughput and latency requirements of closed-loop volumetric-wavefront sensing for both imaging and DE applications. The Phase II effort shall then implement these approaches in a prototype demonstration system to achieve the target performance on a scaled-laboratory optical system. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the proposed work are: \r\n\r\n1) Integrated theoretical algorithms, software and computational hardware systems that can meet the throughput and latency requirements of closed-loop volumetric-wavefront sensing for both imaging and DE applications; and \r\n\r\n2) A demonstrated prototype system, which can achieve the specified target performance on a scaled-laboratory optical system. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. If needed, data of the same level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I work. The Phase II effort may require secure access; if so, SSP will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and SSP in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Create theoretical methods for integrating AI with coherent optical sensor models for accurate estimation of volumetric phase distortion in long-range imaging and DE applications. Perform feasibility analysis of software/hardware pipeline for real-time implementation meeting latency and throughput requirements. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build an integrated algorithmic, software, and hardware prototype system that performs low latency and high throughput computation of accurate wavefront parameters for compensation in imaging and DE applications.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a compact and low power laser system capable of agile generation of all light frequencies required in an atom interferometry application. Demonstrate that the lifetime of all lasers in the optical system is sufficient to support extended periods of operation before required maintenance, and characterize robustness of the system to shock and vibration input.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Light pulse atom interferometry (LPAI) [Ref 1] has been used to perform the most sensitive inertial measurements to date. It is emerging as a candidate technology for inertial sensors (such as gravimeters, accelerometers, and gyroscopes) with unprecedented performance. One obstacle for the development of atom interferometers is the need for further development of compact, robust, and stable laser systems that are capable of producing the requisite laser frequencies for LPAI as well as performing the ancillary functions of atom cooling, state preparation, and state readout. \r\n\r\nCompact and robust laser systems for atom interferometry will facilitate the adoption of this technology in multiple application areas including inertial guidance and navigation and gravity mapping. Shipboard navigation using gravity measurements [Ref 2] to aid a traditional inertial navigation system is a typical use case. These systems may also find use in geophysical surveys for resource exploration. \r\n\r\nThese systems must also have the capability for fast frequency adjustment and shuttering on microsecond timescales. One promising approach is to perform these functions using a number of separate laser sources (such as Distributed Feed Back (DFB)) that are mutually offset-phase locked to a frequency stabilized master laser. The use of agile phase locking enables each output frequency to be adjusted throughout the measurement cycle while enabling the generation of phase-stable Raman pairs for LPAI while reducing the reliance on optical modulators that can be a driver of system power consumption. The Navy’s need is the further development and testing of compact phase-locked laser sources to ensure they can maintain sufficient phase stability for LPAI, can be tuned over 1 GHz repeatedly in a measurement cycle, support long laser lifetimes, and are capable of recovery from shock and vibration.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design for a compact laser system meeting the following requirements: \r\n\r\n• Master laser locked to a saturated absorption feature of an alkali D line \r\n\r\n• Two slave lasers phase locked to the master with offsets ranging from 0 to 5GHz \r\n\r\n• Over 50 mW output power in each frequency component \r\n\r\n• Capable of switching between multiple offset frequencies with switching time under 1ms \r\n\r\n• Volume of optical module under 50 c.c. (not including drive electronics) \r\n\r\n• Power consumption under 3W \r\n\r\nPerform a study of laser lifetimes using laser sources similar to those in the proposed design. Develop a roadmap for achieving system lifetime over 50000 hours. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build a prototype laser module with support electronics meeting the requirements for the design developed in Phase I. Characterize per MIL-STD-810 [Ref 3] for the response of the module to mild vibration and shock inputs. Perform a study of laser lifetimes using similar laser sources to characterize the expected lifetime of the module. Deliver the prototype by the end of Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Compact and robust laser systems for atom interferometry will facilitate the adoption of this technology in multiple application areas including inertial guidance and navigation and gravity mapping. Shipboard navigation using gravity measurements [Ref 2] to aid a traditional inertial navigation system is a typical use case.

Current methods implemented in the program, and those currently used in the industry, are typically time-consuming. Typical present reliability techniques subject a part to elevated temperatures for a period of time to accelerate the aging mechanism. Electrical measurements are (1) functionality, (2) AC parameters, and (3) DC parameters, combined with radiation testing and destructive analysis to determine any alterations in the radiation response and doping process. These techniques are not usually perceptive to small changes in a device. Usually the measurements are taken from outside the part (higher resolution) and the equipment used do not have adequate resolution or sensitivity to discriminate electrical changes within the device itself. \r\n\r\nThe following potential methods are far more superior than previous techniques. They use advanced technology approaches; are far more sensitive than previous methods; and use real-time measurements. Some are noninvasive. This SBIR topic seeks research to apply these methods and determine the sensitivity of these techniques to changes in a semiconductor or electronic component due to aging. A method of transmitting the measurements to a monitoring system will also need to be developed. \r\n\r\n(1) A more advanced noninvasive technique should evaluate an accurate sensor, using solid state electromechanical technologies. [Refs 1,2] \r\n\r\n(2) Another method could be to develop a radio frequency (RF) technique to evaluate the aging effects based on the detection of electromagnetic signature changes from a device. [Refs 3, 4] \r\n\r\n(3) Another acceptable approach should consider an electrical measurement that could detect 1 ppm changes or better with advanced semiconductor technologies. [Ref 5] \r\n\r\nAging of electronics that affect the radiation hardness of a device is a concern. Two effects are (1) Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) affecting p channel transistors in advanced Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies less than 300 nm in feature size, and (2) gold ion diffusion impacting the dose rate threshold performance of a part. The first effect can be monitored via a p channel transistor that can be integrated on the same device. To maximize the sensitivity of detection, different sizes of p channel transistors, channel length and width dimensions would need to be fabricated and tested for NBTI. The second effect is more challenging to measure. Typically, one would irradiate a part at a prompt dose rate facility like an electron beam accelerator or a Flash X-ray machine. Another technique has been to expose a part to a laser tuned to penetrate into the substrate of the part and measure the upset threshold of the part. The upset threshold is compared with a “Gold” standard such as one that did not have gold diffusion or has been aged. \r\n\r\nThe proposed R/D effort is to determine a method of detecting the movement of gold from the die attachment substrate into the silicon bulk substrate and quantify the location of these gold atoms. The spatial resolution needs to be 5 micron or better. One possibility is to leverage on medical imaging techniques used in identifying cancer tumors or in detecting blood clots as in X-ray tomography or radiography. Gold and silicon vary vastly in mass absorption, so the detection of gold is easy with X-rays. Neutron radiography is another approach used in the detection of banned weapons of mass destruction. These are some of the techniques that would be examined to determine the spatial resolution and the sensitivity to identifying the movement of a gold atom in silicon.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop the concept(s) for a test approach(es) or method(s) that will accurately and expediently (80% of typical duration of current/standard tests defined in the applicable standards/specifications for each part technology) measure the aging effects on electronics piece parts as defined in the Description. Provide description(s) of the approach(es), along with corresponding preliminary evidence supporting each approach. Validate the method selected. Identify technical challenges as well as risks and opportunities for the selected method that will be addressed during Phase II. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II. Prepare a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a physical prototype of the proposed test approach or method that meets the capabilities listed in the Description. Demonstrate and validate the test approach or method. Demonstrate the ability of the prototype to meet or exceed the accuracy of current test method results. Identify, document, and demonstrate the time reduction achieved by using the prototype over standard life testing. Identify and document any opportunities for improvements for future iterations.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support in transitioning the technology for Navy use in SSP. Support the Navy with certifying and qualifying the system for SSP use. Navy SSP will provide the assets and test support as Government Furnished Equipment and Services. The accelerated age assessment evaluation test method will be adopted for use in evaluating electronic piece parts currently deployed in missiles. The technology developed can be commercialized into the automotive industry electronics where such devices could be used to determine when a car begins to have aging problems. Another area would be in the commercial airline industry to help diagnose the degradation of aging electronics. Other areas include embedding smart chips either within appliances, smart phones, security systems, and commercial transportation systems to monitor their health. With the miniaturization of microchips, we are seeing the utilization of these devices in humans as well as in electronics to monitor the vital signs and to detect changes rapidly and invasively in an affordable way.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKalgren, P.W., Ginart, A.E., Nanduri, S. et al. “Systems and Methods for Predicting Failure of Electronic Systems and Assessing Level of Degradation and Remaining Useful Life.” U.S. Patent 8103463B2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US8103463B2/en  \r\n\t“Fabrication of advanced silicon-based on MEMS devices.” Analog Devices, U.S. Patent EP1452481B1. https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1452481B1/en  \r\n\tKeller, W., Freeman, S.D. and Galyardt, J. “System and method for physically detecting counterfeit electronics.” U.S. Patent 20120226463A1. https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120226463A1/en  \r\n\tPauly, G.W. and Keller, G.W. “Advanced Manufacturing Monitoring and Diagnostic Tool.” U.S. Patent 8643539B2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US8643539B2/en  \r\n\tNewman, P.F. “Leakage Oscillator Based Aging Monitor.” U.S. Patent 7,592,876. https://patents.justia.com/patent/7592876 \r\n\r\n",

Designed with lifecycle and maintenance costs in mind. Designed with producibility/manufacturability in mind.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: With a new ballistic missile submarine under development (OHIO-Replacement Class SSBN), the capability delivered by the Trident II (D5) missile will be needed into the 2080s. Current D5 missile performance will remain a top priority for life extension efforts while achieving Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) affordability objectives. Currently, hand-built filled and unfilled cables are used, which represent a significant production cost for D5. Finding approaches to improve the producibility of radiation hardened cables and connectors while reducing the impact of nuclear-event induced effects on electronics has the potential for reducing program lifecycle costs. \r\n\r\nMissile modernization will result in avionics architectures that are highly data bus-centric, with electrical connections consisting primarily of power lines and data lines. Such data bus-centric designs require higher data rates over longer distances and require unique interconnect (cables and connectors) interfaces to achieve maximum data transmission while operating in a harsh environment. Operation in a nuclear environment imposes many design challenges, one of which is reducing cable System Generated Electromagnetic Pulse (SGEMP) effects on interface electronics. Current cable designs reduce SGEMP/radiation; however, fabrication is labor-intensive and difficult to replicate in large quantities, since they are hand-built. Because all conductors are point-to-point copper wire throughout the missile, the current design carries a high weight penalty. Producibility and manufacturing repeatability of radiation-hardened interconnects are the subjects of this SBIR topic. An ideal solution must be efficient, reliable, and meet the requirements defined below. \r\n\r\nUsing readily available and common interconnect hardware across the Avionics subsystem will reduce interconnect complexity, thereby reducing overall cost. Rigid flex cabling, fiber optic cabling, and new, robust cable manufacturing techniques must be considered for potential applicability. \r\n\r\nRequirements of the solution: \r\n\r\n• Data transmission rates in excess of 100Mbps (Goal of 10 Gb/s) \r\n\r\n• Radio Frequency (RF)/Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)/SGEMP shielding protection (radiation-hardened) \r\n\r\n• Ruggedness/space flight environment survivability (nuclear, shock, vibration, extreme heat, temperature/humidity cycling) \r\n\r\n• Ease of integration with small form factor and RF-sensitive electronics \r\n\r\n• Design architecture flexibility (low and high current capacity, modular, easily-adaptable interconnects) \r\n\r\nCurrent technology analysis includes: \r\n\r\n• Feasibility of modern printed circuit “Flex Cable” manufacturing techniques for missile applications. \r\n\r\no Maximum “Flex Cable” length practical with current manufacturing techniques \r\n\r\no Feasibility of using “Trapped Electron Reduction cable” SGEMP control techniques, or other alternatives, in Flex cabling \r\n\r\no Feasibility of Incorporating SGEMP terminal protection means (e.g., resistors, caps, diodes) in cable itself \r\n\r\no Ability to support high speed data (>100Mbps) over 40 feet with SGEMP mitigations \r\n\r\no Effectiveness of SGEMP control techniques \r\n\r\no Producibility and cost assessment relative to alternatives \r\n\r\n• Discrete Wire cable techniques (e.g., Trapped Electron Reduction cable [Ref 4]) and potential limitations \r\n\r\no Incorporate SGEMP terminal protection means (e.g., resistors, caps, diodes) in cable itself \r\n\r\no Ability to support high speed data (>100Mbps) over 40 feet with proposed SGEMP mitigations \r\n\r\no Effectiveness of SGEMP control techniques \r\n\r\no Producibility and cost assessment relative to alternatives \r\n\r\n• Fiber/Ethernet/Datalink for high speed data communications and potential limitations \r\n\r\no Application considerations in a Strategic Missile environment \r\n\r\nRadiation darkening of fiber \r\n\r\nFiber connector contamination concerns/mitigation \r\n\r\nFiber Transmitters/Receivers survivability for Strategic radiation-hardened environments o Explore inclusion of fiber with copper in same cable to reduce cable quantity \r\n\r\no Producibility and cost assessment relative to alternatives \r\n\r\no Effectiveness of SGEMP control techniques \r\n\r\no Maintenance cost risk associated with repair/rework/replace compared to traditional copper \r\n\r\no Consider and assess existing high bandwidth/speed cable options (i.e., fiber vs. Ethernet vs. Datalink) and assess risks/tradeoffs \r\n\r\n• Analysis of new/emerging technologies, to include: \r\n\r\no Ultra-miniature connectors that provide robust capability in smaller form factor \r\n\r\no Ability to integrate high speed data transmission contacts with traditional copper contacts \r\n\r\no Explore options in connector grommet seal techniques/processes to reduce well-known fleet issues (e.g., silicone migration, damaged pins/tines, Foreign Object Damage (FOD) contamination) \r\n\r\no Producibility/repeatability of EMI-shielding techniques and processes \r\n\r\no Producibility of new connectors that meet or exceed the current solution functionality and reliability \r\n\r\no Alternate backshell/connector accessories. Current configuration requires special tooling and difficult processes\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop approaches for the fabrication and production of radiation-hardened cables and connectors that reduce the effects of SGEMP while maintaining the performance characteristics of a high bandwidth interconnect for use in strategic missile environments. With the basic cable design understood, construct a decision matrix and analyze several feasible interconnect solutions. Utilize aforementioned analyses to begin connector down-select process. Ensure that the proposed approaches are low cost and use high-reliability interconnect hardware and simple, proven fabrication techniques. \r\n\r\nConduct a feasibility assessment for the proposed application, assessing benefits and drawbacks of various approaches that address, at a minimum, the capabilities/limitations listed in the topic description.

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): Hypersonics\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Electronics; Information Systems\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a high-fidelity design-level modeling environment for radar seeker subsystems that captures the relevant operational and environmental constraints of hypersonic flight. The model will be configurable to perform low level design tradeoffs in a standalone environment or operate as a subsystem in closed-loop 6DOF architectures for end-to-end integrated performance evaluation.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: In order to develop and simulate advanced radar seeker concepts at the extreme conditions associated with hypersonic flight, there is a need to develop a modeling capability that considers the mission-specific challenges for the potential seeker concepts. Government laboratories need a robust seeker modeling capability to perform research involving fundamental design tradeoffs for future concepts, as well as to efficiently predict operational performance. Seeker models are used at all stages of the weapon simulation process. In flight simulations of an integrated munition, the seeker may provide an alternative means of navigation and directly feed guidance, acquiring the target and selecting an aimpoint in the presence of target location error. For modeling and simulation to be relevant, DoD acquisition guidance stresses the need to continually refine the model based on results from experimental data collection. The acquisition trend toward validated “digital twins” further emphasizes the need for a high-fidelity seeker model operating with Radio Frequency (RF) that follows a concept from inception through operational deployment. The desire for conforming to Weapon System Open Architecture interface standards also benefits from high-fidelity models that allow the assessment of standard conformity and data validity. \r\n\r\nHypersonic weapons in particular provide challenges that stress the functional performance of the seeker subsystem. Current modeling tools do not integrate the effects of the aero-thermal and thermo-elastic impacts of the hypersonic environment on measurement accuracy. It is essential to model the impact of aerodynamic heating for specific radome/antenna placement and deformation of exotic airframes built of materials such as Inconel and titanium alloys. It is also important to model the in-depth heating, static deformation, and modal dynamics of the structure when they impact measurement accuracy. The ability to interface with Government-developed Fluid-Thermal-Structural-Interaction (FTSI) models, even during real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation, is desired to capture the impact of the environment on guidance performance. The required tool should not only allow for front end design signal processing simulation, but also backend processes such as image formation and target identification. The ability to impart and assess the impacts of kinematic constraints on data acquisition and signal processing functions is essential. An RF sensor on a weapon that plans to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS) will need to pick a different waveform than a sensor flying at more conventional speeds. RF seekers on weapons do not have the favorable squint angle of a side-looking radar and will be expected to operate in steep, extended, terminal dives. Conventional “stop and hop” radar models may have errors when they assume the beginning of the transmit pulse and end of the receive pulse are close in space and the speed of the weapon is far from the speed of light. \r\n\r\nThe developed technology will be transitioned to Navy and other DoD facilities. For proof of concept and evaluation, the processing architecture must be baselined to communicate/interface with the existing 6DOF engagement systems, FTSI modeling capabilities, and radar scene modeling capabilities. Detailed knowledge of RF seeker design, seeker functional requirements in a munition environment, and hypersonic environmental constraints is critical. Understanding and modeling of the impact of emerging technologies will be required. A requirements assessment during Phase I will determine Use Cases and required interface compatibility with other government systems. Designs with software modularity that allow for incremental increase in fidelity are possibly of benefit to accommodate budgetary and programmatic constraints. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. If needed, unclassified data of the same level of complexity as classified data will be provided to support Phase I work. The Phase II effort will likely require access to classified information, and SSP will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and SSP in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Establish Use Cases and develop a simulation architecture that can meet the RF seeker modeling goals identified. Physical models and dependencies will be determined along with fidelity requirements associated with each Use Case. Document the design and trades made to reach the conclusions. Design risks will be determined and to the extent possible proof of concept for the approach taken will be accomplished. The software design should use best practices to provide for readability, modification, scalability, maintenance, and verification. In Phase I, model limitations will be identified that need to be addressed during Phase II. Phase II objectives and demonstration plans will be identified. The Phase I Option if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype model for a subsystem of a hypersonic seeker based on a hardware design. The prototype shall be based on the results of Phase I and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW). The prototype shall be in a language such as C++ or other highly efficient, stable, executable form. The Government shall have access and full Government purpose rights to all source code. Work with Navy subject matter experts, which may include Government personnel and contractors, to develop and demonstrate the prototype and integrate this prototype into a standalone design environment and 6DOF simulation forms. Fully document the prototype design and interfaces. Work together with the Government to analyze the results of all models that are integrated into the hypersonic seeker model as it performs relevant hypersonic engagement scenarios and vignettes. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy and Air Force in transitioning the technology to DoD use. In addition to NSWC Crane and AFRL/RW, other DoD and DoD contractor facilities will be identified as potential users of this technology. The final product supports multiple applications from early conceptual design through mature validated digital representation of an operational seeker. The end product will allow evaluation of software changes and will allow for planning of mission compatibility of the seeker technology. The system needs to be fully supportable and maintainable by the government so that models can be moved between Use Cases for a given weapon system application. The system needs to be adaptable and expandable as technology improves. This technology can also be used to model other problems where high speed maneuvering with radar sensor data collection is needed. Example applications are collision avoidance and terrain mapping for both commercial airplanes and future autonomous cars.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tClive, Peter. “Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integrating, and Modeling (AFSIM).” International Conference on Scientific Computing (CSC’15). www.worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2015/CSC7058.pdf  \r\n\tDirector, Systems and Software Engineering Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics). “Systems Engineering Guide for Systems of Systems”, August 2008 (recently revised). acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Systems-Engineering-Guide-for-Systems-of-Systems-Aug-2008.pdf  \r\n\tBalz, T. “Real-time SAR simulation of complex scenes using programmable graphics processing units.” Proceedings of the ISPRS TCVII Mid-term Symposium. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200148298_Real-time_SAR_simulation_of_complex_scenes_using_programmable_Graphics_Processing_Units \r\n\r\n",

While GPS has become a pervasive technology for military uses, it has security and availability challenges. In recent years, the ability to compromise GPS has been demonstrated by adversaries using jamming techniques that interfere with military mission execution. The research on this SBIR topic is intended to explore alternative technology solutions that would utilize natural or man-made signals of opportunity that may be available throughout the world to provide navigation precision comparable to GPS. Proposed approaches should be appropriate for the high-velocity and challenging environmental conditions associated with hypersonic flight or low earth orbit. The proposed approaches must be demonstrated in analysis or simulation to be able to provide precision equaling that of GPS in all weather conditions, at high altitude, at high velocity (hypersonic speeds), and must be broadly applicable throughout the world. Additional challenges include consistent reliability and size, weight, and power that would be compatible with current and future weapon systems, and communicate signals similar to GPS output codes (PY-code and M-code). Research and development is needed to demonstrate the feasibility of natural and man-made signals to satisfy these requirements. The research should be conducted with the goal of designing and demonstrating a prototype navigation system, and as such a system design for the use of these alternate signals should be considered. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. If needed, data of the same level of complexity as secured data will be provided to support Phase I work. The Phase II effort is anticipated to require secure access, and SSP will process the DD254 to support the contractor for personnel and facility certification for secure access. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA).

The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Propose specific innovative solutions for an alternative navigation approach, as opposed to simply proposing to study the problem. Specific natural or man-made signals should be identified along with the approach used for meeting the requirements stated in the Description. Demonstrate the feasibility of the approach to provide required accuracy, and the usefulness to military applications, including those associated with hypersonic weapons and space. Provide mathematical descriptions of the physical processes and signal processing being performed. In addition, modeling and simulation should be used to demonstrate feasibility for required applications. The required sensing maturity and signal processing requirements should be addressed in light of future size, weight, and power requirements. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II. Develop a Phase II plan that includes a Phase II Statement of Work (SOW) that identifies a work plan that provides proof of concept that the technology has the potential to meet the military performance goals highlighted in Phase I.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design and build a prototype with enough detail for development and demonstration of a navigation system based on the non-conventional signals addressed in Phase I. Use a combination of hardware, software, and modeling and simulation to maximize demonstration of feasibility to meet military objectives within the cost constraints of the program. Experimental data collection of the navigation signal sources is desired where appropriate and cost-effective. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Government in transitioning the technology for Government use. The transitioned product is expected to be able to support current and future weapon and space systems, as well as a wide range of other air, land and sea-based systems. Commercial applications should be considered for transition (e.g., telecommunications, ocean transportation, commercial satellite and mapping systems). Depending on the technology, it may apply beyond navigation on earth. The primary objective of this project is for transition to defense contractors for high speed weapons and space systems. To meet these needs, maturation and packaging of the technology to meet practical size, weight, and power constraints will be required. Extreme environments may require special considerations to conform to airframe shape and shielding from the aerothermal environment.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRaquet, John F.; Miller, Mikel M.; and Nguyen, Thao Q. \"Issues and Approaches for Navigation Using Signals of Opportunity.” Proceedings of the 2007 National Technical Meeting of The Institute of Navigation, San Diego, CA, January 2007, pp. 1073-1080. https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=7203  \r\n\tMcEllroy, Jonathan A. “Navigation Using Signals of Opportunity in the AM Trans-Mission Band.” Master&#39;s Thesis, Air Force Institute of Technology, 2006. https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a456511.pdf  \r\n\tShamaei Kimia; Khalife, Joe: and Kassas, Zaher M. “Exploiting LTE Signals for Navigation: Theory to Implementation.” IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, Vol. 17, Issue. 4, April 2018. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8255823 \r\n\r\n",

Examples of existing research on photon-counting image sensors can be found in the Refs 1-5. In terms of idealities, these image sensors should be capable of high-speed (>1000 frames per second), low-noise (sub-electron) readout in a photon-counting mode without the need for deep cooling; have high-density (approx. 1 µm) pixel pitch; be radiation-hard at strategic levels; have low power consumption, and be able to be fabricated using CMOS foundry processes.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform a design and performance modeling study aimed at image sensors with improved performance for strategic star trackers as compared to the current state of the art.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop high power density, small heavy fuel prime power generator technology for next generation directed energy weapons. The technology should be highly optimized for size and weight, and should be scalable to enable development of a family of small generators, with designs including power ratings ranging from 5kW to 25kW in 5kW increments, and capable of supporting 100% of duty cycle requirements.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Currently available prime power sources that power directed energy weapon systems are very large and heavy and preclude integration on small tactical vehicles and unmanned systems. These power systems today are primarily composed of hybrid power systems of very large/heavy (100’s of pounds) high voltage batteries and/or large 1000 pound+ high voltage gas-diesel generators. Payload volumes and weight margins on most small tactical vehicles/platforms simply cannot accommodate or support these large payload volumes nor the extra weight. An example of this would be the current Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System (LMADIS) which employs a 5 kilowatts (kW) diesel generator weighing 300 lbs. that results in the vehicle weighing 15 lbs. over the maximum gross vehicle weight (GVW) of the current ULTV. Future mission growth to add additional communications equipment to LMADIS is expected to increase the power demands to 10 kW. Currently available diesel generators that meet the higher power requirements weigh close to 500 pounds (lbs) and would result in the vehicle weighing 100 to 150 lbs. over maximum GVW. Compact and lightweight power generation systems are needed to power these directed energy weapon, surveillance, and C2 systems and keep the vehicle safely within its allowable GVW. The system requirements are: \r\n\r\nScalable prime power generator designs are to include 5kW, 10kW, 15 kW and 20kW designs and support 100% duty cycle requirements and range in size and weight from (for the 5kW generator design). \r\n\r\n• Size and Weight (exclusive of fuel tank and mounting frames): \r\n\r\no For a 5kW genset, Volume Threshold of 1,300 cu in. and Objective of 1,000 cu in.; Weight Threshold of 40 lbs (8 lb/kW) and 30 lbs (6 lb/kW) Objective \r\n\r\no For a 25kW genset, Volume Threshold of 3,500 cu in. and Objective of 3,000 cu in.; Weight Threshold of 175 lbs (7 lb/kW) and 150 lbs (6 lb/kW) Objective \r\n\r\n• Fuel Efficiency: For all ratings, Threshold fuel consumption rate of 275 g/kWh and Objective of 240 g/kWh \r\n\r\n• Fuel: JP-8 \r\n\r\n• Electrical Output: 28VDC, less than 1% ripple \r\n\r\n• Noise: Less than 70 dbA at 30 feet, at full (rated) power \r\n\r\n• Duty cycle: Eight (8) hours of operation at rated (100%) power \r\n\r\nGenerators designs are based on optimized overall system size and weight and with overall system efficiency to achieve very high fuel efficiency such as < 250 gm/kW-h; \r\n\r\no Composed of lightweight materials such as Aluminum, be air-cooled, run on JP-8 (heavy fuels) \r\n\r\no Be extremely quiet (< 70 dbA at 30 feet at full power) \r\n\r\no Have a compact form-fit of less than 500 cu inches (with fuel tank) o Run 100% power for an 8 hour mission \r\n\r\no Run close to diesel engine efficiencies but with much less mass than a standard diesel generator – weight/power goal of < 0.5 lbs/hp o Run with realistic prop speeds of less than 1000rpm \r\n\r\no Run with low exhaust noise o Have a long lifetime with a mean time between failures (MTBF) of > 3000 hours; \r\n\r\no Be compatible with 24-VDC tactical electrical systems and 12-VDC vehicle electrical systems; \r\n\r\no Incorporate electrical component and connections with an ingress protection rating of Ingress Protection( IP67) or higher in accordance with (IAW) American National Standards Institute (ANSI) / International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60529-2004; \r\n\r\no Have a modular design that can be inspected, serviced, and repaired in the field \r\n\r\nThe program requires the development at least one small heavy fuel generator set (genset) in the required power range, which shall be scalable (up and or down in power rating) in order to enable the development of the small generator family described above, through the entire power range of 5kW to 25kW. The design shall be optimized for weight and size, utilizing light weight, durable materials, and shall be designed to have a mean time between failure (MTBF) of at least 3,000 hours. A complete, fully operational prototype genset shall be constructed and tested to demonstrate compliance with the technical requirements, including, size, weight, and performance. \r\n\r\nCurrently only diesel powered generators within the desired power range can achieve fuel consumption at the required rates; however, their large size and weight make them unsuitable for the intended application. A compact, lightweight, efficient, JP-8 fuel capable, reliable, and very quiet system is necessary to meet the mobility and compatibility requirements of potential platforms for the directed energy weapon systems. For higher power ratings, advanced gas turbine engine driven, high speed generators now under development can achieve near diesel efficiency; however, as the power rating and size decrease below about 40kW, their efficiency falls substantially, hence the need to develop new technologies for the high power density, small generators as described in these requirements. \r\n\r\nNote: The current active Phase II USMC SBIR N132-086 to develop a Compact Prime Power Generator (CPPG) for Non-Lethal Directed Energy Weapons supports the development of a 40 kW to 1.6MW recuperated gas-turbine generator design. The generator design supports higher power directed energy weapon requirements. Its size and weight is optimized over this 40kW to 1.6MW power region. The Phase II SBIR prototype will produce 300 kW, support a 100% duty cycle, consume the same fuel as a standard gas-diesel generator (19.3gph) – same fuel burn rate as the MEP-809 at rated power, weigh only 480 lbs., and have a compact form-fit of < 20 cu ft. This SBIR topic requests an optimized scalable minimum size and weight lower power prime power source (generator) for the following NL DEW power requirements: 5kW, 10kW, 15 kW, and 20 kW. The current USMC Phase II SBIR design which employs a scalable recuperator gas-turbine generator design does not provide the smallest and lightest design at these lower power levels. A different more optimized generator design is required to fully optimize size and weight at these lower power requirements. \r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA). The selected contractor and/or subcontractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances, in order to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and MCSC in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material IAW DoD 5220.22-M during the advanced phases of this contract.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: For this Direct to Phase II (DP2) topic, the Government expects that the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-type effort. It must have developed a concept for a workable prototype or design to address at a minimum the basic requirements of the stated objective above and it must have already developed a commensurate prototype in hardware, i.e., developed a large number of the components necessary to achieve the required Power Output per pounds and per cubic feet of form-fit. \r\n\r\nDocumentation showing a prime power gas-diesel power generation system is feasible and that the system requirements discussed in the Description are in the realm of possible. The small business should have produced a model to evaluate different approaches to optimize powering directed energy weapons on a small tactical vehicle/platform. The small business should show they have identified higher power density electrical efficiencies with lightweight materials and long MTBF to meet this SBIR DP2 topic’s scalable output power goals of 5kW, 10 kW, 15 kW, and 20 KW and weight ~50 lbs; and a compact form-fit of < 100 lbs and 1500 cu inches (e.g., the size of a small Honda 1 kW generator). \r\n\r\nFEASIBILITY DOCUMENTATION: Proposers interested in participating in Direct to Phase II must include in their responses to this topic Phase I feasibility documentation that substantiates the scientific and technical merit and Phase I feasibility described in Phase I above has been met (i.e., the small business must have performed Phase I-type research and development related to the topic, but feasibility documentation MUST NOT be solely based on work performed under prior or ongoing federally funded SBIR/STTR work) and describe the potential commercialization applications. The documentation provided must validate that the proposer has completed development of technology as stated in Phase I above. Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results. Work submitted within the feasibility documentation must have been substantially performed by the proposer and/or the principal investigator (PI). Read and follow all of the DON SBIR 21.1 Direct to Phase II Broad Area Announcement (BAA) Instructions. Phase I proposals will NOT be accepted for this BAA.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the Phase I equivalent effort and the Phase II plan, develop and use analytical modeling to assist in design and integration of high power density, small heavy fuel prime power generator technology for next generation directed energy weapons. Build scalable prime power generator prototypes for both fitment and functionality of power generation to support directed energy weapon systems. Support evaluation of prototypes to determine if the performance goals defined in the Phase II development plan and the requirements outlined in MIL-STD-1275E and MIL-STD-810H have been met. Demonstrate system performance through modeling and generator testing under full electrical load conditions. Refine the design based on the results of testing/modeling to facilitate integration on small tactical vehicles (such as the JLTV) and or other DoD Platforms as well as facilitate integration on small unmanned systems. Support full power tests of these directed energy weapon systems on DoD platforms. Prepare a Phase III plan to transition the technology to the Marine Corps and the commercial marketplace. \r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Provide support to the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use. Refine a prime power generation system for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment. Support the Marine Corps test and evaluation program to qualify the system for Marine Corps use. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications include Department of Homeland Security and civilian law enforcement missions.

"branch": "Navy",

"topic_description": "RT&L FOCUS AREA(S): General Warfighting Requirements;Machine Learning/AI\r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Air Platforms;Information Systems;Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop, validate, and migrate to the cloud a digital twin of Cartridge Actuated Devices/Propellant Actuated Devices (CAD/PAD) that use double-base propellants while providing real-time health monitoring of deployed devices based on the environmental exposure.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy requires digital twin technologies, which allow the digital footprint of any product to permeate throughout the CAD/PAD devices’ entire service life from design inception, through development, sustainment, and finally to disposal. Digital twin technology is viable and allows access to the digital image of the asset in real time, leading to secure actionable information that will improve a process, product, or service of any organization [Ref 1]. The concept has been around for a while, as shown during the disaster of the Apollo 13 mission. NASA demonstrated the technology with a mirrored system on the ground, which rescued the flight, and is further illustrated in [Ref 2]. Digital twin technology involves creating a virtual representation of a physical product. Digital twins are powered by machine learning algorithms and are continuously learning systems. The products are connected in a cloud-based environment that receives the data from the sensors or other available data sources. The input data is analyzed and compared to the CAD/PAD device baseline data to identify actionable information. \r\n\r\nThe goal for the CAD/PAD digital twin technology is to design, test, and develop a product in a virtual environment and to monitor product health to identify potential degradation. This will allow real-time monitoring and replacement of the product utilizing its maximum safe life, which will reduce product’s life cycle costs. In the future, the goal is to have a digital twin model for selected CAD/PAD devices hosted in the cloud and updated with historical deck plate data to make the model more robust. The frequency of the digital twin updates will coincide with approved for release historical deck plate and sensor data.\r\n\r\nBecause of the large variety of CAD/PAD devices and the numerous failure modes associated with these devices, this topic seeks to pursue a digital twin model for CAD/PAD items that employ double-based propellants. Double-based propellants will deplete its stabilizer at a faster rate when exposed to high temperature. A comparative study of the thermal decomposition of naturally- and artificially-aged double-based propellants has been carried out at five different heating rates and the results show that there is only one decomposition peak on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves, and this decomposition has been accelerated by ageing. The influence of the heating rate on the DSC behavior of the propellants was verified. The kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor and the thermodynamic parameters were obtained from DSC data [Ref 3]. The aging of CAD/PAD items containing double-based propellants are dependent on the environmental conditions, such as temperatures, to which they are subjected. The digital twin being developed will take these environmental conditions and determine the stabilizer content of the CAD/PAD items. The environmental conditions are dependent upon the operational location and duration of the aircraft at the location. \r\n\r\nIn order to determine the environmental exposure of the CAD/PAD items, the developed digital twin should all be able to use both collected sensor data and a combination of deck plate data and available weather data, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or local installation data, in order to determine stabilizer content. The developed digital twin predicted stabilizer content should be validated against measured stabilizer content of fleet return assets with known environmental exposure. \r\n\r\nUpon successful demonstration, the contractor should assist in obtaining the necessary approvals for use of the developed digital twin and migration into a cloud-based environment compliant with all applicable Navy Marine Corp Internet (NMCI) and applicable Operations Security (OPSEC) requirements. \r\n\r\nDigital twin technology is not widespread due to the requirements of prohibitive computing power needs, accessibility, bandwidth, and storage issues. Lack of robust data analytics aided by artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, and visualization tools is impeding technology development. Digital twin technology has the potential to improve supply chain integrity, flight safety, in-flight service, Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), foreign object detection, and predictive maintenance. For example, developing any predictive maintenance algorithm requires sensor data, which can be utilized to train a classification algorithm for fault detection. This algorithm is used for verification and is installed as a code to the control unit of the product. It is nearly impossible to create the fault conditions necessary for training a predictive maintenance algorithm on the actual product. A solution to this challenge is to create a digital twin of the product (a model), and apply simulation and analysis of sensor data for various fault conditions. A neural network detects abnormal patterns of the sensor data, reflects the trends in predictive models, which are then used to predict failures, and allows tests for all fault conditions with severity. The entire procedure should be automated, thereby allowing tests of “what-if” scenarios on the digital twin model. Predictive maintenance helps to determine when an aircraft product needs maintenance or replacement. It reduces downtime and prevents product failure by enabling maintenance or replacement of the CAD/PAD device to be scheduled based on the actual need rather than at predetermined intervals. It can be used to calculate maintenance-related parameters (i.e., MTBR – Mean Time Between Replacement), forecast the behavior of the product under different circumstances, and simulate different maintenance scenarios. Thus, predictive maintenance capability helps to extend the product life and reduce total ownership costs. Collectively, it will contribute significantly to improving the Navy’s mission readiness and sustainment. It is envisioned that the CAD/PAD program will be able to develop a virtual integrated, model-based representation of a physical product, allow the simulation of the product in a real setting in a dynamic fashion, and demonstrate closed loops between the virtual and physical space. \r\n\r\nChallenges for this effort include developing an accurate model that precisely reflects the physical twin’s properties. For predicting failures, detailed blueprints of a product’s failure modes are required. Since the digital twin is a replica of the physical product itself, the requirements, qualification, and certification necessary to determine the flight worthiness of the product are the same for the virtual model as well. The expected outcomes of the effort are real-time monitoring and health status of the deployed CAD/PAD items. This will enable prolonged product life to deliver capabilities continually. For the proof of concept, the Parachute Deployment Rocket Motor (PDRM) [DODIC MT29], the Under Seat Rocket Motor (USRM) [DODIC MD68], and the Catapult Primary Cartridge [DODIC WB15] will be used for the demonstration of the digital twin model. \r\n\r\nThe developed digital twin model should be capable of predicting remaining stabilizer content within 20% of measured values. The developed digital twin should be migrated into a cloud-based environment and be capable of meeting all NMCI and OPSEC regulations and requirements. The developed digital twin should be capable of utilizing both historical aircraft location/weather data and sensor data.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: For a Direct to Phase II topic, the Government expects that the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-type effort. Have developed a concept for a workable prototype or design to address, at a minimum, the basic requirements of the stated objective above. The below actions would be required in order to satisfy the requirements of Phase I: \r\n\r\nDesigned and developed a digital twin capable of predicting stabilizer content based on environmental exposure of deployed devices. \r\n\r\nDetermined and demonstrated the model’s prediction of the cockpit temperature gradient based on aircraft location and available weather data. \r\n\r\nFEASIBILITY DOCUMENTATION: Offerors interested in participating in Direct to Phase II must include in their response to this topic Phase I feasibility documentation that substantiates the scientific and technical merit and Phase I feasibility described in Phase I above has been met (i.e., the small business must have performed Phase I-type research and development related to the topic, but from non-SBIR funding sources) and describe the potential commercialization applications. The documentation provided must validate that the proposer has completed development of technology as stated in Phase I above. Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results. Work submitted within the feasibility documentation must have been substantially performed by the offeror and/or the principal investigator (PI). Read and follow all of the DON SBIR 21.1 Direct to Phase II Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Instructions. Phase I proposals will NOT be accepted for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build, refine, enhance, and validate (against measured stabilizer content of fleet returned assets (MT29 and WB15) with known environmental exposure) a prototype product (a high-fidelity model) by integrating the physical asset to the digital twin and demonstrate the closed loop between physical - virtual - physical space. Demonstrate the applicability of readiness and sustainment influencing factors such as CBM, predictive maintenance, and flight safety with quantifiable metrics. Quantify the cost benefits, such as reduction in the operation cost and total lifecycle cost, as applicable. Demonstrate the applicability of Navy provided “what-if” scenarios tested against factors such as product performance management, Navy-unique harsh environmental operating conditions, and future operating environments. Assist in obtaining approvals for the developed digital twin’s use and migrate the digital twin into a cloud-based environment. Demonstrate compliance with NMCI requirements and end user access.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Develop robust architecture, showing the linkage between connectivity and services. Demonstrate the integration of the product into naval aircraft and perform final testing. Successfully transition, implement, and insert the technology for warfighter benefits. Develop mobile application solutions as applicable. Aerospace industry employs cartridges that use double-based propellants and will benefit from the digital twin technology. The successful demonstration of the digital twin of the product that is operationalized will enable the applicability of the approach to any product/process/service industry to achieve cost benefits. \r\n\r\nThe private sector (e.g., commercial aerospace industry and private military fleets) use similar cartridges as the ones used in military aircrafts. Some of these cartridges employ double-based propellants as their energy source and experience similar propellant-stabilizer depletion issues. The digital twin model developed under this SBIR topic will provide those industries a mean of tracking the health of the installed devices and assist them in making replacement decisions based on the environmental exposure of the devices. The digital twin model will enable the private sector to utilize maximum safe life of the devices and enhance the safety of their operations.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tParrott, A. and Warshaw, L. “Industry 4.0 and the Digital Twin: Manufacturing Meets Its Match.” Deloitte Insights, May 12, 2017. https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/industry-4-0/digital-twin-technology-smart-factory.html  \r\n\tGrieves, M. and Vickers, J. “Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems.” Transdisciplinary perspectives on complex systems, 2017, pp. 85-113. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4  \r\n\tTrache, D. and Khimeche, K. “Study on the influence of ageing on thermal decomposition of double-base propellants and prediction of their in-use time.” FAM Fire and Materials: An International Journal, 37(4), May 15, 2012, pp. 328-336. https://doi.org/10.1002/fam.2138 \r\n\r\n",

This results in a requirement for numerous antennas designed to work in different sections of the Radio Frequency spectrum to be installed.  This is typically done with each available receiver/transmitter planned for the operation in mind being connected to a single antenna, the design of which is optimized for operation in the section of the spectrum for which the associated receivers/transmitters are configured to operate.  This does not support flexibility of the Radio Frequency sensing system.  In cases where receivers/transmitters must be reconfigured to operate in different frequency ranges, cables must be reconnected and often new antennas installed in an effort to meet ever changing mission requirements.  This often results in a lack of equipment needed to make necessary changes and delay in reconfiguration which may affect the ability to support emergent SOF missions.  \r\n\r\nPHASE I:  Conduct a study to determine the technical feasibility of developing a system that will allow multiple radio receivers/transmitters to access multiple antennas with configuration and reconfiguration accomplished by remote means.  USSOCOM has a requirement to distribute Radio Frequency energy received by a number of antennas, each of which is designed to operate optimally in a specific section of the Radio Frequency spectrum, to different Radio Frequency receivers/transmitters, each of which will be configured to operate in a specific section of the Radio Frequency spectrum.  Additionally, the requirement is for the receivers/transmitters to be able to retune and switch between antennas for periodic use of any of the antennas connected to the distribution network.  The general requirement for this SBIR topic is to enable a series of receivers/transmitters to access various antennas, each designed to operate most efficiently in a specific section of the Radio Frequency spectrum, electrically, electronically or mechanically by a remote operator using control software.\r\n\r\nThe Offeror shall develop a means by which a series of Radio Frequency antennas, each optimized for performance within a specific section of the Radio Frequency spectrum, can be accessed by a series of Radio Frequency receivers / transmitters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAntennas shall be proposed by the Offeror with the primary focus being electrical performance of each individual antenna.  Size, weight and Power consumption (SWaP) are also under consideration as a secondary attribute of each antenna.\r\n\tReceivers/transmitters hardware shall be proposed by the Offeror.  It shall be fully compatible with each proposed antenna. \r\n\tThis technology pursuit is to develop a method by which each receiver/transmitter in a series can be remotely, a method that does not require “touch maintenance”, configured to operate with any of the proposed antennas.  There may be cases where more than one receiver/transmitter must access a single antenna and each time this occurs, the secondary receivers/transmitters shall automatically be configured for receive only.\r\n\tThis topic automates the reconfiguration process necessary to attach receivers/transmitters to different antennas from its current manual labor method. \r\n\tA final feasibility study report and preliminary design shall be delivered to allow Government acquisition officials the opportunity to make future acquisition decisions on a fully informed basis.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (“Technology Readiness Level 3”) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.  The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.  It should also address the risks and potential payoffs of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary.  Operational prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II:  Develop, install, and demonstrate a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution during the Phase I feasibility study on an Antenna Distribution System. The prototype will be tested with sensors currently in the SOF inventory to determine level of performance and in an attempt to make the test articles ready for testing in a pseudo-operational environment.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  This system could be used in a broad range of military applications where radio devises are used.  For example, this antenna distribution system could provide a means by which communications devices on a mobility platform, such as an airplane or ship, could make use or an antenna distribution system to reduce the requirement for a number of individual antennas currently required on the platform.  In this case, limited physical space can be opened up to other devices as antennas are removed due to the distribution system providing the capability to map specific radios to specific antennas remotely when the connection is needed.  This capability can easily be applied to sensor systems such as those used to detect distant RADAR systems or unknown radio transmitters. Upon completion of a successful demonstration of this capability with radio sensors, other Methods of Employment such as RADAR detection of communications support can be tested.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tTechnical Standard for Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA) Reference Architecture, Edition 1 Version 3 Copyright 2020.

"topic_description": "TECHNOLOGY FOCUS AREA: Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning; Network Command, Control and Communications; \r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY AREAS: Sensors; Electronics; Battle Space\r\n\r\nACQUISITION PROGRAM: Near Vertical Direction Finding \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE:  The objective of this topic is to develop applied research toward an innovative capability to dramatically increase Radio Frequency (RF) sensitivity, with the purposes of developing a method to preform passive, analog RF fingerprinting of individual, modern communications devices in real-time at a standoff range. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: As a part of this feasibility study, the proposers shall address all viable overall system design options with respective specifications on RF linearity, frequency resolution, operational ranges, discrimination capability and protocols and standards in which specified techniques are effective or ineffective. Specifically, this SBIR topic is asking for technologies which go beyond protocol identification by analog characteristics, but rather asking for technology candidates which can delineate individual emitters, within a given protocol. The potential proposers will then study the feasibility of these techniques of a list of the most widely used commercial protocols. Of additional interest is the ability to perform this discrimination across a wide instantaneous bandwidth, across multiple protocols simultaneously. The detection and discrimination should be performed at a standoff range which is to imply that the device being identified is at a distance in which visual identification is not possible. \r\n\r\nThe attached reference presents a good overview, but this SBIR is asking to preform one level deeper of discrimination and at a standoff range.  \r\n\r\nPHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility study to assess what is in the art of the possible that satisfies the requirements specified in the above paragraphs entitled “Objective” and “Description.”  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (“Technology Readiness Level 3”) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.  The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.  It should also address the risks and potential payoffs of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary.  Operational prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II:  Develop, install, and demonstrate a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution during the Phase I feasibility study on a stand-alone system. The device should be capable of determining individual emitters by their analog characteristics in real-time. These systems may be considered for shipboard, airborne or ground-based applications. \r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  This system could be used in a broad range of military applications where the need for additional sensitivity of RF emissions is required. This could be used to develop unique broadband signatures using unique broadband signatures (URE) of non-RF devices – (i.e Broadband signature of Tesla vs Honda by unique URE of engine systems) or to increase detection ranges.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tLaput, G., Yang, C., Xiao, R., Sample, A. and Harrison, C. 2015.

Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals, their country of origin, and what tasks each would accomplish in the statement of work in accordance with section 5.4.c.(8) of the solicitation. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE:  The objective of this topic is to develop applied research toward an innovative capability to replace the current Field Computing Device – Wearable (FCD-W) with open system architecture.  Specific focus of this topic investigates improving human factors as a result of excessive cabling, developing a smart hub for plug and play use of peripheral devices, integrating a secure personal area network on the smart hub capable of being certified for processing higher levels of classification, and integrating additional processing capabilities into the smart hub.   \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The FCD-W variant was adopted in the TACLAN program back in 2016 in response to a Combat Mission Needs Statement.  Since the inception of the FCD-W, several incremental changes have been made to replace the End User Device and upgrade versions of the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) but the overall functionality of the system has remained the same.  USSOCOM is seeking a direct to phase II SBIR to advance the FCD-W capability while meeting the following high level objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDesign a rugged tactical USB cabled solution \r\n\tDevelop a tactical hub and prove feasibility of smart hub features \r\n\tImplement power and data management\r\n\tDevelop connections to tactical radios, peripheral equipment, and tactical batteries for system power  \r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE I:  The Offerors shall conduct requirements analysis and perform design trade-offs, feature feasibility risk reduction, design validation prototyping, and developmental testing to achieve the stated development objectives. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (“Technology Readiness Level 3”) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.
