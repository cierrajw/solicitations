"topic_description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\r\n\r\nThe NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate the lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives and Scope\r\n\r\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews or other procedures of clinical research; however, applications that propose to conduct intervention studies will not be considered responsive to the FOA and will not be reviewed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\r\n\r\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\r\n\r\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\r\n\r\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\r\n\r\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\r\n\r\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics\r\n\r\nCollaboration between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\r\n\r\nCommercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers, especially women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons, to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\r\n\r\nMilestone\r\n\r\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives, in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.",

"topic_description": "The educational objective of this FOA is to provide opportunities for eligible SBCs to submit NIH SBIR grant applications to develop IDM STEM products that address student career choice and health and medicine topics for: (1) pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12) students and teachers or (2) informal science education (ISE) audiences. The second educational objective is to inform the American public that their quality of health is defined by lifestyle. If this message is understood, people can begin to live longer and reduce the healthcare burden to society. Therefore, this FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. The research objective of this FOA is the development of new educational products that will advance our understanding of how IDM STEM-based gaming can improve student learning. It is anticipated that increasing underserved and minority student achievement in STEM fields through IDM STEM resources will encourage these students to pursue health-related careers that will increase their economic and social opportunities. A diverse health care workforce will help to expand health care access for the underserved, foster research in neglected areas of societal need, and enrich the pool of managers and policymakers to meet the needs of a diverse population.\r\n\r\nIDM is a bridge technology that converts game-based activities from a social pastime to a powerful educational tool that challenges students with problem solving, conceptual reasoning and goal-oriented decision making. Well-designed IDM products mimic successful teacher pedagogy and exploit student interest in games for learning. IDM STEM products also integrate imbedded learning, e.g., what the student knows and new knowledge gained in the gaming process, into problem solving skills. IDM products provide real time student assessment. Unlike standardized classroom testing where student achievement is a pass or fail process, IDM-based assessment is interactive, does not punish the student, and provides feedback on how to move to the next level of play. IDM products are intended to generate long-term changes in student performance, educational outcomes and career choices.\r\n\r\nThis FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. Types of applications submitted to this FOA may vary with the target audience, scientific content, educational purpose and method of delivery. IDM STEM products may include but are not limited to: game-based curricula, resources that promote attitude changes toward learning, new skills development, teamwork and group activities, public participation in scientific research (citizen science) projects, and behavioral changes in lifestyle and health. IDM STEM products designed to increase the number of underserved students, e.g., American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, disabled, or otherwise underrepresented individuals considering careers in basic, behavioral or clinical research are encouraged.\r\n\r\nIDM STEM products may be designed for use in-classroom or out-of-classroom settings, e.g., as supplements to existing classroom curricula, for after-school science clubs, libraries, hospital waiting rooms and science museums. IDM products may target children in group settings or individually, with or without adult or teacher participation or supervision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project may use any IDM gaming technology or platform but the platform chosen should be accessible to the target group.\r\n\r\n",

"topic_description": "Background\r\n\r\nThe Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative is a Presidential project aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. It is expected that the application of these new tools and technologies will ultimately lead to new ways to identify, treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.\r\n\r\nNIH is one of several federal agencies involved in the BRAIN Initiative. Planning for the NIH component of the BRAIN initiative is guided by the long-term scientific plan, \"BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision,\" which details seven high-priority research areas and calls for a sustained federal commitment of $4.5 billion over 12 years. This report can be found at http://braininitiative.nih.gov/. This FOA and other FOAs issued in Fiscal Year 2018 are based on NIH&#39;s careful consideration of the recommendations of the BRAIN 2025 Report, and input from the NIH BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the National BRAIN initiative, the NIH continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research and in technology development, including through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. \r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nBased on the priority areas identified by the BRAIN 2025, and in further evaluation of the neurotechnologies currently available to neuroscience researchers, it was determined that there is a need to enable broad dissemination of tools/technologies that improve our understanding of brain function. Many of these inventions require additional research and development (R&D) before they can be disseminated to the broader neuroscience community. To fill this research gap, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) which uses the STTR grant mechanism, will support to support the development of novel neuroscience tools and technologies in order to better understand the structure and function of brain circuits- a major goal of the BRAIN Initiative. This FOA will support further development of neurotechnologies developed through the BRAIN initiative or through other funding programs in preparation for commercial dissemination.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the activities proposed will require partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and Small Business Concerns (SBCs), which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple program directors/principal investigators. \r\n\r\nExamples of neurotechnologies that would be appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to, development of: \r\n\r\nWhile some of the markets for these products may be small, NIH is supportive of developing these technologies towards sustainable commercial manufacture. The full development and dissemination of these technologies will enable neuroscientists to perform novel hypothesis-driven experiments that are not feasible and/or reduce barriers to experiments that currently are too costly, difficult, or time consuming to perform broadly.   \r\n\r\nFor more information about neurotechnologies that may be of interest for this FOA, please see the BRAIN website:  https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/index.htm\r\n\r\nProjects with non-exempt human subjects research will not be supported by this FOA.

"topic_description": "Background\r\n\r\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States. These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to translate promising technologies and products to the private sector that align with their mission to improve health and save lives. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR program, as established by law and reauthorized under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834 and Public Law 115-232, is intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increase the private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal research and development funding; foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons. In addition, the STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their budget to SBIR, and those with research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside 0.45% of funds for STTR. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR/STTR program is a phased program. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. \r\n\r\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). \r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-20-261 or PA-20-265. \r\n\r\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  \r\n\r\nNIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH Direct to Phase II will accept Phase II submissions regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award. \r\n\r\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be a strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed SBIR Phase IIB project. Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, or a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants should provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details on any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors.\r\n\r\nNIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR FOA or other specific FOAs, are listed in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives\r\n\r\nThe PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In addition to the general SBIR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses. \r\n\r\nApplicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.\r\n\r\nAll applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement must propose clinical trial(s).

"topic_description": "\r\n\t\r\n\t\tRapid advances are being made in wearable technology, including clothing, jewelry and other devices with broadly diverse functions that meet medical or consumer needs.  This FOA seeks applications from small businesses that propose to design and produce a non-invasive wearable device to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time.\r\n\r\n\t\tAlcohol detection technology for personal alcohol monitoring has been successful in judicial and law enforcement settings, yet needs significant modification for wider use in other situations.  Current technological developments in electronics, miniaturization, wireless communication, and biophysical techniques of alcohol detection in humans increase the likelihood of successful development of a general use alcohol biosensor in the near future.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe alcohol biosensor device should be unobtrusive, appealing to the wearer, and can take the form of jewelry, clothing, or any other format located in contact with the human body. Techniques to quantitate alcohol in blood or interstitial fluid are highly encouraged. Highest priority will be given to technologies that depart from measuring alcohol in sweat or sweat vapor.  Applicants are encouraged to pursue any technology - including but not limited to biophysical, optical, wave, or other novel approaches- that works in a non-invasive way and can be incorporated into a wearable.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe device should be able to quantitate blood alcohol level, interpret, and store the data or transmit it to a smartphone or other device by wireless transmission.  The device should have the ability to verify standardization at regular intervals and to indicate loss of functionality.  The power source should be dependable and rechargeable.  Data storage and transmission must be completely secure in order to protect the privacy of the individual.  A form of subject identification would be an added benefit.  The device can be removable. \r\n\r\n\t\tIt is envisioned that wearable alcohol monitors will serve useful purposes in research, clinical, and treatment settings, will play a role in public safety, and will be of interest to individuals interested in keeping track of personal health parameters. Designs may emphasize any of these potential market subsets or may seek to be broadly marketable.     \r\n\r\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

"topic_description": "\r\n\t\r\n\t\tFetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most widely used growth supplement for cell culture; it cost-effectively supports the survival, growth, and differentiation of many cell lines by providing nutrients, growth signals, and protection from stress. Although serum is an effective growth promoter, it is variable in its composition, activity, and effects on cellular phenotypes. This variability introduces inconsistencies into research using cultured cells. Sometimes it is possible to replicate experimental results only if the same manufacturer&#39;s serum is used; sometimes replication is only possible using serum from the same lot. Vendor literature and scientific reviews advise investigators to test lots of serum to identify those that support the desired cellular responses, and then buy a quantity of the best lot for long term use. This practice is widespread but can make replication of results by others difficult.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum contains hundreds, perhaps thousands, of constituents. These include macromolecules, small molecules, and trace elements; for any cell line a large and variable subset of these may be active in supporting cell growth. The composition and concentrations of factors in serum vary with the source animals&#39; diets, geographical locations, gestational stages, gender, health, season of harvesting, and histories of exposures to hormones, antibiotics, and environmental chemicals. Harvesting practices, manufacturing processes and additives, and differences in quality control and handling introduce additional variation. Serum is a byproduct of the meat-processing industry; dependence on serum is a barrier to translation of cell-based therapies because of the risk of transmission of viruses, prions, endotoxins, and immunogens.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum supplies factors that support cell growth through mechanisms that are not well understood, but includes hormones, enzymes, extracellular vesicles and proteins, extracellular matrix constituents, attachment and spreading factors, vitamins and minerals, trace elements, lipids, protease inhibitors, and other stabilizing and detoxifying factors. Substitute formulations for serum are expensive and time-consuming to develop and are cell-type specific; some cell lines cannot be grown with presently-available serum replacements. Although serum substitutes can support the growth of many cell types in culture, they often do not support robust survival and the same range of responses as does serum. Thus, serum continues to be widely used in many research settings where it is not economically practical to customize substitutes for it.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) addresses the needs of developers and users for supporting technologies and products to expedite (a) development of better serum substitutes, (b) identification of serum constituents that are effective in promoting the culture and responses of specific cell lines, and (c) troubleshooting of experimental variation stemming from variability in serum. This FOA will support SBIR projects to develop reliable and cost-effective tools; projects may develop new technologies or improve upon existing technologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSynthetic serum replacements, both general purpose and specialized for particular cell types. Development of minimal base formulations for customization by users into serum substitutes for specific cell lines.\r\n\t\t\tGeneral purpose analytical tools to detect constituents in serum. Tools for rapid evaluation of variation in serum composition, and for comparison of serum batches.\r\n\t\t\tSpecialized methods, tools and products for identification and evaluation of factors and activities in serum affecting adherence, survival and phenotypes of particular cell types.\r\n\t\t\tDevelopment of bioactive products for inclusion in serum replacements or to supplement reduced media, such as components that would assist the adherence of cells and promote correct morphology.\r\n\t\t\tAffordable methods for production of serum components such as growth factors.\r\n\t\t\tToolkits to assist users to develop serum replacements.\r\n\t\t\tMethods, tools, and products for detecting and clearing biological and chemical contaminants, such as viruses, prions, endotoxins, immunogens, etc.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\tSee Section VIII.

There is an analogous need to digitize similar\r\ntypes of analog data in satellite telemetry (also with Ampex tapes) and medical\r\nrecords (e.g., electrocardiograms), as part of acquiring a broader base of\r\ninformation for historical recordkeeping and research purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThreats to the loss of information in legacy analog and\r\ndigital recordings include the degradation of the physical media and the large\r\nphysical space required to store the records.  Cataloging and scanning the\r\nanalog data are a way to triage and preserve the data, but this is only the\r\nfirst step of a path toward a scientifically useful product. Grant applications\r\nare sought in the following areas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.     \r\nDigitization of Legacy Seismo-acoustic Waveform Data\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to improve the\r\nrobustness and automation of techniques to rapidly and accurately digitize\r\nanalog records of legacy seismo-acoustic waveform data.  Scanning records has\r\nlimitations in the tradeoff between scanning time vs. resolution.  A variety of\r\noriginal recording technologies (e.g., paper helicorders, film develocorders),\r\neach with associated idiosyncrasies, generated data that must be recovered [1,\r\n2, 3, 4].  Of interest are methods that streamline the scanning and\r\ndigitization process, ideally allowing for treatment of a variety of original\r\ndata types and correcting for complications such as overlapping signals,\r\nrotating drum distortions, and time marks.  The resulting techniques would\r\nenhance legacy data digitization by enabling automated translation of\r\nhistorical data into a useable form.  Digitizations of interest include signal\r\nand noise spectra at frequencies from approximately 0.02 to 20 Hz and timing\r\nprecision that can be quantified.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.     \r\nMethods to Readily Read, Recover, and Organize Legacy Digital Storage\r\nMedia\r\n\r\nResearch is needed to develop\r\nmethods to readily read, recover, and organize data from legacy digital storage\r\nmedia (e.g., DAT, 9-track, etc.) before these media degrade and become\r\nunreadable [1, 2].  Information of interest includes file formats, as well as\r\nsensor and catalog metadata.  Metadata includes operational time period and\r\nsite information, as well as full digital data recovery.  Particular attention\r\nis needed for reading aging media (physically and magnetically weak), including\r\nthe possibility that media may break and degrade beyond usability after a few\r\nread cycles [3, 4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.      \r\nAnalysis Methods to Identify the Instrument Response Function (IRF) for\r\nDe-convolution\r\n\r\nThe recorded trace on a\r\nseismometer is the incident ground motion convolved with the response function\r\nof the sensor and data acquisition system.  It is necessary to remove the\r\nresponse function from the data in order to obtain the true measured time\r\nhistory of ground motion.  Methods of removing the response function exist if\r\nit is known [1, 2].  However, for a signal recorded from a legacy instrument,\r\nthe amplitude and phase response of the instrument may not have been\r\npreserved.  Many of these legacy instruments no longer exist and records of\r\ncalibrations performed during their lifetime may be missing or incomplete.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe challenge is to conduct\r\nresearch to devise methods of analyzing the waveform time series represented in\r\nthe legacy data to estimate the sensor and data acquisition instrument response\r\nfunction (IRF).  The frequency passband required for seismic waveform analysis\r\nis primarily over the operational monitoring band of 0.02 to 20 Hz, but also of\r\ninterest are methods applicable at lower frequencies down to 0.0083 Hz\r\n(120-second periods).  Possible approaches can include, but not limited to,\r\nanalysis of the microseism and other background noise [3], analysis of recorded\r\nevents in the historical archive with known signal characteristics (such as\r\nlarge magnitude earthquakes), and comparison of the legacy IRF to other nearby\r\nseismometers with known response functions that may have been operating during\r\noverlapping time periods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA potential approach is to develop\r\na signal analysis algorithm to identify the amplitude of the first and\r\nsubsequent peaks, and to derive the uncertainty in these values, given an IRF\r\nand a noise spectrum model, or in a self-consistent analysis in which the full\r\ntrace constrains how significant the IRF and noise are in modifying the size of\r\nthe largest peaks and features. An outcome of interest is to generate such a\r\nself-consistent analysis from a legacy recording trace, and deduce limits on\r\nhow much influence the IRF or noise would have on the amplitude of the major\r\npeaks (primarily the first one), to produce the “true amplitude” and its\r\nuncertainty.  There might be analogous applications in medical record analyses\r\n(e.g., elucidating relative size of s- vs. t- waves vs. other elements of\r\nelectrocardiogram traces) [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.     \r\nOther\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specific\r\nsubtopics listed above, grant applications in other areas relevant to this\r\ntopic are invited.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Thomas Kiess,\r\nthomas.kiess@nnsa.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic a:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nGomes e Silva, A.

A significant challenge for\r\nanalytical imaging technologies is the characterization of a single region of\r\ninterest by complementary methods, which requires precise sample positioning,\r\nidentification of features that warrant analysis by different analytical\r\ntechniques, relocation of regions or features with high accuracy (typically\r\nwithin a few micrometers) on different analytical platforms, correlation of\r\nanalytical signals from disparate technologies (e.g., reflected light,\r\nsecondary electrons or ions, x-ray fluorescence, etc.), and visualization\r\n(e.g., 2-D or 3-D surface mapping).  Therefore, of interest to DNN R&D are\r\ninnovative solutions to (i) rapidly scan surfaces using various microscopies,\r\n(ii) efficiently correlate microanalytical images that provide complementary\r\ninformation, (iii) combine images so that they correctly align, and (iv) enable\r\n2-D and 3-D surface mapping that combine disparate analytical data.  Regions of\r\ninterest can require cross-platform spatial resolution of one micrometer or\r\nless.  For example, features of interest can be identified by rapid scanning\r\nusing one or more imaging techniques (e.g. optical, SEM, SIMS, etc.); regions\r\nare relocated on a separation analytical platform for further analysis at short\r\nlength scales; disparate information streams (e.g., chemical, elemental,\r\nisotopic, morphologic) are correlated to align or overlay features at high\r\nspatial resolution; and finally, optical images are then utilized to develop a\r\n2-D or 3-D surface map combining all analytical information.  Research is\r\nneeded to achieve rapid scanning and spatial alignment of surface maps made by\r\neach microscopy to the same x-y-z position.  Materials of interest may be\r\naffixed to sample holding substrates made of various materials (e.g., glass,\r\ncarbon, plastic, silicon, gold, aluminum, or steel).

On the\r\nsupply-side, there is a shift from large synchronous generators to smaller,\r\nlighter units (e.g., gas-fired turbines) and variable energy resources (e.g.,\r\nrenewables) with utility scale energy storage. On the demand-side, there is a\r\ngrowing number of distributed energy resources, as well as a shift from large\r\ninduction motors to rapidly increasing use of electronic converters in\r\nbuildings, industrial equipment, and consumer devices. The monitoring and\r\ncontrol systems used for operations are also transitioning from analog systems\r\nto systems with increasing data streams and more digital control and\r\ncommunications; from systems with a handful of control points at central\r\nstations to ones with potentially millions of control points.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrid modernization will require the adoption of advanced\r\ntechnologies, such as smart meters, automated feeder switches, fiber optic and\r\nwireless networks, energy storage, and other new hardware. It must also\r\nencompass and enable the application of intelligent devices, next-generation\r\ncomponents, cybersecurity protections, advanced grid modeling and applications,\r\ndistributed energy resources, and innovative architectures. Integration of\r\nthese technologies will require a new communication and control layer to manage\r\na changing mix of supply- and demand-side resources, evolving threats, and to provide\r\nnew services.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe transition to a modern grid will create new technical\r\nchallenges for an electric power system that was not designed for today’s\r\nrequirements. Customers have never relied more on electricity, nor been so\r\ninvolved in where and how it is generated, stored, and used. Utilities will\r\ncontinue retrofitting the existing infrastructure with a variety of smart\r\ndigital devices and communication technologies needed to enable the\r\ndistributed, two-way flow of information and energy.

At the same time, our reliance on\r\nelectricity has grown and tolerance for power interruptions have decreased.\r\nThis means that new operators are entering into an increasingly demanding\r\nenvironment – and may not have much time to learn through trial and experience\r\non the job. Additionally, system operators are facing these new challenges as\r\nthe workforce is aging – stressing existing operator training norms. New\r\nmethods or simulators for training system operators are needed to help train\r\nthe changing workforce. Understanding what system operators require to make\r\ninformed decisions and analysis, human factors innovation in visualization and\r\ndecision making can enable more effective training for new operators. Training\r\nmethods that are able to help the operator learn the uniqueness of the system\r\nthey will be operating, as opposed to a generic power systems, are needed to\r\nmeet the growing complexity of the system. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this subtopic\r\nshould consider:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nState of the art of human factors and cognitive science research \r\n\r\n·        \r\nState of the art visualization methods, including tools not\r\ntraditionally used in the power sector\r\n\r\n·        \r\nUser training and ease of user experience\r\n\r\n·        \r\nMulti-sector system training given electricity system\r\ninterdependences with other sectors (such as natural gas). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCollaboration with power system\r\noperators and utility engineers is strongly encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sandra\r\nJenkins, sandra.jenkins@hq.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic a:\r\n\r\n1.

Grid-tied energy storage systems add\r\nvaluable functionality such as renewable firming, frequency regulation, power\r\nquality enhancement, and dynamic stability support. Grid storage will\r\nultimately improve the reliability, flexibility, security, and quality of the\r\nexisting electricity utility grid.

Critical electrical components\r\nused in PCS are semiconductors, magnetics such as transformers and inductors,\r\nand capacitors. With the advances in wide bandgap semiconductor devices such as\r\nSiC and GaN, new topologies for PCSs are emerging due to their high switching\r\nfrequency, high junction temperature, and high breakdown voltage capabilities.\r\nThere is increased interest in the usage of high-frequency link converters by\r\nutilizing dual active bridge technology.

Innovation\r\nResearch in Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Semiconductor Chip\r\nDesign for Edge Computing in Manufacturing \r\n\r\nThe objective of this subtopic is\r\nto maintain US manufacturing leadership by providing small business\r\nopportunities to develop technologies that will be applied in next-generation\r\nmanufacturing [1]. Small businesses that provide applied Artificial\r\nIntelligence (AI) semiconductor technology design and concept development are\r\nafforded the opportunity to work with US semiconductor fabricators to bring AI\r\ntechnology that will rely on 5G broadband wireless communications to\r\napplications in the US manufacturing sector [2]. Many technologies that are\r\npresently applied in manufacturing process control, for example, that rely on\r\nwired communication links, will be superseded by wireless communications, and\r\nadaptive control approaches based on AI and machine learning strategies will be\r\npossible with the digital computing power that will be accessible with 5G\r\nbroadband wireless communications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits feasibility\r\nresearch in new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that\r\nwill enable AI application in edge computing applications such as automatic\r\ncontrol. This subtopic reflects DOE’s support for to enable 5G/Advanced\r\nWireless Technologies as part of its focus on enabling the Industries of the\r\nFuture as well as DOE\\EERE’s support for Advanced Microelectronics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe introduction of 5G broadband\r\nwireless communications will enable manufacturers to access resources available\r\nonly with 5G wireless – such as cloud computing and complex wireless sensor\r\nnetworks. This broadband access, in turn, will facilitate the application of\r\ndigital computing at points of access or presence in manufacturing operations\r\n(edge computing). This includes AI applications in automatic control of\r\ndiscrete and continuous processes. Open and closed loop control in\r\nmanufacturing requires sensing of process or operation variables and the\r\napplication of algorithms by controllers to act on sensor measurements to\r\ncontrol final elements in control loops. AI-based control approaches derive\r\nalgorithms for closed loop control and models for open loop control using a\r\nvariety of machine learning approaches to analyze data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nASIC designs developed for this subtopic\r\nare expected to be 5G compatible and be of direct use in edge computing applied\r\nto US manufacturing, such as applications in automatic control.

Grant\r\napplications responsive to this Phase 1 funding opportunity will specify the\r\nproposed end use in US manufacturing of new ASIC designs, the AI and machine\r\nlearning approaches to be applied by the ASIC, the possible integration of the\r\nASIC into an edge computing system, and discuss the benefits of the possible\r\nnew technology as compared with current manufacturing practice in the US.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Brian\r\nValentine, Brian.Valentine@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Novel\r\nManufacturing Methods for Membranes and Desalination System Components\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop continuous, precise, and smart manufacturing techniques that have\r\nthe potential to lower the cost and facilitate the adoption of high-performance\r\nmembrane materials and design architectures. Together, such changes in design\r\nand materials manufacturing methods could substantially reduce the time to\r\nmarket for new membranes critical for desalination of water. Novel\r\nmanufacturing methods must be explored to ensure new materials for membranes\r\nand desalination systems can be produced with suitable low-cost and\r\nscalability. Therefore, the R&D supported under this subtopic must improve\r\nmaterials, design, and manufacturability of high-performance membranes and\r\ndesalination system components with the goal of reducing costs relative to\r\ncurrent methods. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the\r\nobjectives of the Water Security Grand Challenge, a DOE-led framework to\r\nadvance transformational technology and innovation to meet the global need for\r\nsafe, secure, and affordable water [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must address one of the\r\nfollowing three areas of interest to be considered responsive to this subtopic:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nLow-cost membrane materials and manufacturing methods: R&D is needed\r\nto advance the next generation of membrane materials and manufacturing methods.\r\nResearchers developing new membrane materials must balance material performance\r\n(e.g., separation properties, thermal conductivity, catalytic activity),\r\nagainst robustness (e.g., mechanical, chemical) and manufacturability (e.g.,\r\ncost, scalability). Materials R&D can lead to improvements in surface\r\nchemistry and interfaces that enable development of materials having 1)\r\nhigh-target ion selectivity, 2) high contaminant removal and water\r\npermeability, and 3) greater chemical resistance, antifouling and\r\ncorrosion-resistance compared to state of the art. Innovations in both membrane\r\nmaterials and related manufacturing methods could vastly expand the range of\r\nwater chemistries over which modular membrane systems are cost-competitive and\r\npotentially eliminate the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and\r\npost-treatment. Innovations in high-performance materials and multifunctional\r\nmembranes enabled by new approaches in materials discovery, synthesis, and\r\ncharacterization are sought. Novel methods of manufacturing that lower cost and\r\nimprove chemical and hydrodynamic performance that could substantially lower\r\nthe energy intensity, levelized cost of water (LCOW), water intensity, and\r\nfailure frequency of treatment processes to increase the nation’s ability to\r\ntap nontraditional water sources also are sought. Such materials for membranes\r\nmay become more cost effective if they can leverage recent additive, gradient,\r\nand roll-to-roll manufacturing advances that lower production costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nManufacturing ultra-low cost, high sensitivity sensors and sensor\r\nnetworks for water quality measurements and detection of emerging contaminants:\r\nCurrent water treatment systems are designed to operate at nominally\r\nsteady-state conditions, relying on human intervention to adapt to variations\r\nin water quality and correct failures in process performance. Simple, robust\r\nsensor networks coupled with sophisticated analytics and controls systems could\r\nenhance performance efficiency, process reliability, and treatment process\r\nadaptability while minimizing the need for onsite, manual interventions. These\r\ninnovations could significantly lower the cost of distributed, fit-for-purpose\r\ndesalination systems and their operational expenses, thus reducing the overall\r\ncost of water treatment This area of interest is focused on developing new,\r\ninnovative sensors and overcoming related manufacturability challenges for high\r\nsensitivity sensors and sensor networks for water quality measurements and\r\ndetection of emerging contaminants. These sensor data could be used to optimize\r\ndesalination and other water treatment processes. Data needs for process\r\ncontrol and monitoring could also be addressed through these new sensors and\r\nsensor networks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nNovel methods and technologies for in-situ characterization of membranes\r\nduring roll-to-roll or otherwise continuous manufacturing: Traditional\r\nmanufacturing methods can hinder the adoption of novel materials and new\r\narchitectural designs in desalination system components such as membranes. To\r\nreduce membrane costs, there is a need to develop roll-to-roll (R2R) platforms\r\nand other continuous manufacturing processes that allow careful control of\r\nmembrane microstructure and performance.

Innovation\r\nResearch in Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Semiconductor Chip\r\nDesign for Edge Computing in Manufacturing \r\n\r\nThe objective of this subtopic is\r\nto maintain US manufacturing leadership by providing small business\r\nopportunities to develop technologies that will be applied in next-generation\r\nmanufacturing [1]. Small businesses that provide applied Artificial\r\nIntelligence (AI) semiconductor technology design and concept development are\r\nafforded the opportunity to work with US semiconductor fabricators to bring AI\r\ntechnology that will rely on 5G broadband wireless communications to\r\napplications in the US manufacturing sector [2]. Many technologies that are\r\npresently applied in manufacturing process control, for example, that rely on\r\nwired communication links, will be superseded by wireless communications, and\r\nadaptive control approaches based on AI and machine learning strategies will be\r\npossible with the digital computing power that will be accessible with 5G\r\nbroadband wireless communications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits feasibility\r\nresearch in new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that\r\nwill enable AI application in edge computing applications such as automatic\r\ncontrol. This subtopic reflects DOE’s support for to enable 5G/Advanced\r\nWireless Technologies as part of its focus on enabling the Industries of the\r\nFuture as well as DOE\\EERE’s support for Advanced Microelectronics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe introduction of 5G broadband\r\nwireless communications will enable manufacturers to access resources available\r\nonly with 5G wireless – such as cloud computing and complex wireless sensor\r\nnetworks. This broadband access, in turn, will facilitate the application of\r\ndigital computing at points of access or presence in manufacturing operations\r\n(edge computing). This includes AI applications in automatic control of\r\ndiscrete and continuous processes. Open and closed loop control in\r\nmanufacturing requires sensing of process or operation variables and the\r\napplication of algorithms by controllers to act on sensor measurements to\r\ncontrol final elements in control loops. AI-based control approaches derive\r\nalgorithms for closed loop control and models for open loop control using a\r\nvariety of machine learning approaches to analyze data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nASIC designs developed for this subtopic\r\nare expected to be 5G compatible and be of direct use in edge computing applied\r\nto US manufacturing, such as applications in automatic control. Small\r\nbusinesses providing promising new ASIC designs would be expected to work with\r\nsemiconductor circuit manufactures to fabricate the new ASIC and integrate\r\nthese into edge computing systems that would be used by manufacturers, with a\r\nspecified purpose such as automatic control of processes and operations. Grant\r\napplications responsive to this Phase 1 funding opportunity will specify the\r\nproposed end use in US manufacturing of new ASIC designs, the AI and machine\r\nlearning approaches to be applied by the ASIC, the possible integration of the\r\nASIC into an edge computing system, and discuss the benefits of the possible\r\nnew technology as compared with current manufacturing practice in the US.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Brian\r\nValentine, Brian.Valentine@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

"subtopic_description": "b.      Novel\r\nManufacturing Methods for Membranes and Desalination System Components\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop continuous, precise, and smart manufacturing techniques that have\r\nthe potential to lower the cost and facilitate the adoption of high-performance\r\nmembrane materials and design architectures. Together, such changes in design\r\nand materials manufacturing methods could substantially reduce the time to\r\nmarket for new membranes critical for desalination of water. Novel\r\nmanufacturing methods must be explored to ensure new materials for membranes\r\nand desalination systems can be produced with suitable low-cost and\r\nscalability. Therefore, the R&D supported under this subtopic must improve\r\nmaterials, design, and manufacturability of high-performance membranes and\r\ndesalination system components with the goal of reducing costs relative to\r\ncurrent methods. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic supports the\r\nobjectives of the Water Security Grand Challenge, a DOE-led framework to\r\nadvance transformational technology and innovation to meet the global need for\r\nsafe, secure, and affordable water [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must address one of the\r\nfollowing three areas of interest to be considered responsive to this subtopic:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\nLow-cost membrane materials and manufacturing methods: R&D is needed\r\nto advance the next generation of membrane materials and manufacturing methods.\r\nResearchers developing new membrane materials must balance material performance\r\n(e.g., separation properties, thermal conductivity, catalytic activity),\r\nagainst robustness (e.g., mechanical, chemical) and manufacturability (e.g.,\r\ncost, scalability). Materials R&D can lead to improvements in surface\r\nchemistry and interfaces that enable development of materials having 1)\r\nhigh-target ion selectivity, 2) high contaminant removal and water\r\npermeability, and 3) greater chemical resistance, antifouling and\r\ncorrosion-resistance compared to state of the art. Innovations in both membrane\r\nmaterials and related manufacturing methods could vastly expand the range of\r\nwater chemistries over which modular membrane systems are cost-competitive and\r\npotentially eliminate the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and\r\npost-treatment. Innovations in high-performance materials and multifunctional\r\nmembranes enabled by new approaches in materials discovery, synthesis, and\r\ncharacterization are sought. Novel methods of manufacturing that lower cost and\r\nimprove chemical and hydrodynamic performance that could substantially lower\r\nthe energy intensity, levelized cost of water (LCOW), water intensity, and\r\nfailure frequency of treatment processes to increase the nation’s ability to\r\ntap nontraditional water sources also are sought. Such materials for membranes\r\nmay become more cost effective if they can leverage recent additive, gradient,\r\nand roll-to-roll manufacturing advances that lower production costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\nManufacturing ultra-low cost, high sensitivity sensors and sensor\r\nnetworks for water quality measurements and detection of emerging contaminants:\r\nCurrent water treatment systems are designed to operate at nominally\r\nsteady-state conditions, relying on human intervention to adapt to variations\r\nin water quality and correct failures in process performance. Simple, robust\r\nsensor networks coupled with sophisticated analytics and controls systems could\r\nenhance performance efficiency, process reliability, and treatment process\r\nadaptability while minimizing the need for onsite, manual interventions. These\r\ninnovations could significantly lower the cost of distributed, fit-for-purpose\r\ndesalination systems and their operational expenses, thus reducing the overall\r\ncost of water treatment This area of interest is focused on developing new,\r\ninnovative sensors and overcoming related manufacturability challenges for high\r\nsensitivity sensors and sensor networks for water quality measurements and\r\ndetection of emerging contaminants. These sensor data could be used to optimize\r\ndesalination and other water treatment processes. Data needs for process\r\ncontrol and monitoring could also be addressed through these new sensors and\r\nsensor networks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.     \r\nNovel methods and technologies for in-situ characterization of membranes\r\nduring roll-to-roll or otherwise continuous manufacturing: Traditional\r\nmanufacturing methods can hinder the adoption of novel materials and new\r\narchitectural designs in desalination system components such as membranes. To\r\nreduce membrane costs, there is a need to develop roll-to-roll (R2R) platforms\r\nand other continuous manufacturing processes that allow careful control of\r\nmembrane microstructure and performance. For example, development of new\r\nceramic and composite materials could be accelerated to commercial scale with\r\nresearch on additive and R2R manufacturing, enabled by development of methods\r\nto deposit ceramics on complex shapes and rough surfaces. These advances\r\nrequire the development of 1) in-situ characterization techniques that enable\r\ncontrol of membrane properties during manufacturing; 2) in operando materials\r\ncharacterization techniques that facilitate understanding of membrane\r\nperformance under varying conditions; and 3) manufacturing innovations that enable\r\nthe scalable deployment of novel membrane materials in cost-competitive\r\nmodules. Process optimization could be achieved by advanced characterization\r\ncapabilities, such as in-situ X-ray scattering during R2R processing.\r\nCutting-edge characterization tools at national user facilities could be\r\nleveraged for materials and processes design and optimization of membrane\r\nmanufacturing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Melissa\r\nKlembara, Melissa.Klembara@ee.doe.gov\r\n",

Increasing representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and\r\nengineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research project should\r\ninvestigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbusiness’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that\r\ncould be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall\r\noutcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this\r\nresearch that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.\r\nIdeally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and\r\ntechnologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality\r\nwithin the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,\r\ndemonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with\r\nparallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving\r\nworkplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their\r\nproject with these improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest under\r\nthis subtopic include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of software to foster experiential learning mediated\r\nby employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy\r\ncurriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address\r\nbarriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nResearch to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,\r\nand retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence or other data-driven\r\nplatforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive\r\noperational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if\r\naddressed, can improve business success and expansion. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a robust\r\nevaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce\r\ndevelopment program proposed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications that propose the\r\nfollowing will not be considered for award under this subtopic:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConventional internship and training programs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of this topic includes\r\ncompletion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or\r\ntool.

"subtopic_description": "b.      Cultivating\r\na More Competitive Bioeconomy Through Strengthening Small Business Workforces\r\n\r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals that pilot a research-driven workforce development\r\nprogram or tool that can be widely applicable for the bioeconomy, establishing\r\na partnership with business experts in bioenergy and/or inclusive workforce\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBecause biomass exists across\r\ngeographically diverse regions (i.e., agricultural crops, forestry residues,\r\nMunicipal Solid Waste, algae), people living in urban, suburban, and rural\r\nareas across the country could all benefit from careers and opportunities in\r\nthe bioenergy industry. Increasing representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbioenergy industry will support a more competitive domestic science and\r\nengineering workforce to lead the way on innovation in the global economy [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research project should\r\ninvestigate questions related to the representation and inclusivity within the\r\nbusiness’ workplace in relation to technical and operational challenges that\r\ncould be inhibiting its commercial objectives in the bioeconomy. The overall\r\noutcome is to create a workforce development program or tool through this\r\nresearch that improves the commercialization potential of the business partner.\r\nIdeally outcomes of this R&D are scalable mechanisms, platforms, and\r\ntechnologies for increasing and improving diverse representation and equality\r\nwithin the bioeconomy’s workforce. This could include, but is not limited to,\r\ndemonstrated success in increasing recruitment of trained professionals with\r\nparallel skills from job sectors that have declined domestically, improving\r\nworkplace retention from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering, and Math (STEM) and/or leadership positions; and correlating their\r\nproject with these improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest under\r\nthis subtopic include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of software to foster experiential learning mediated\r\nby employer-educator partnerships that will ensure the alignment of bioenergy\r\ncurriculum with workplace demands. This software or technology should address\r\nbarriers associated with urban and rural areas as well as engaging people with\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds within bioenergy R&D and deployment.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nResearch to identify gaps in workforce development, recruitment,\r\nand retention within bioenergy fields of future workers/employees from\r\nunderrepresented backgrounds and implementation of a multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram to address these gaps at the small business. The multi-year data-driven\r\nprogram will provide a roadmap for other small businesses.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence or other data-driven\r\nplatforms that identify the impact of lacking or underdeveloped inclusive\r\noperational and/or commercial practices on workforce development that, if\r\naddressed, can improve business success and expansion. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a robust\r\nevaluation plan to track and demonstrate the success of the workforce\r\ndevelopment program proposed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications that propose the\r\nfollowing will not be considered for award under this subtopic:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of traditional curricula or courses on bioenergy\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nConventional internship and training programs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of this topic includes\r\ncompletion of research and beta-testing of the workforce development program or\r\ntool. Phase II includes the deployment of this technology at the bioeconomy\r\nbusiness and scaling the tool to other businesses.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Devinn\r\nLambert, Devinn.Lambert@ee.doe.gov.\r\n",

Remote sensing data, including visual\r\nimagery and other sensor data types (such as infrared or other spectrums) can\r\nbe processed and leveraged for the pre-population of building characteristics\r\nfor use in existing building evaluation platforms. For more information on this\r\ntopic, applicants should refer to BTO’s building data science research,\r\nresources, and tools website [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApproaches should leverage\r\nstandardized data systems, such as Audit Template, BuildingSync, HPXML, ASHRAE\r\n223P, and other relevant management tools to synthesize and aggregate remote\r\nsensing data for automated import into building energy evaluation tools.\r\nProposals should build upon existing tools to meet the requirements for a\r\nremote audit or virtual building inspection and support further identification\r\nof energy efficiency measure opportunities on a site by site basis with similar\r\nresults to traditional auditing techniques.

Building\r\nEnergy Modeling\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits R&D\r\nproposals for new methods, tools, applications for whole building energy\r\nmodeling (BEM) and closely related areas. BTO’s goal is to expand the effective\r\nuse of BEM in all use cases, supporting energy efficiency, demand flexibility,\r\nor both.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhole building energy modeling\r\n(BEM) is a multi-purpose tool for building energy efficiency. At the individual\r\nbuilding project level, it supports optimized design of new and retrofitted\r\nbuildings and districts, HVAC equipment selection, sizing, and control design,\r\ncode-compliance, ratings and certificates, and incentives. BEM on prototypical\r\nmodel supports the development of energy-efficiency codes, design guides,\r\nincentive programs, and products. BEM also has some applications in building\r\noperations. Although BEM typically implies physics-based modeling,\r\nreduced-order, data-driven, and hybrid models have been demonstrated to be\r\nsufficient for some applications and have both model development and execution\r\ntime advantages over physics-based models.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals may target any BEM use\r\ncase (e.g., design, code-compliance, portfolio analysis), any sub-task\r\nassociated with one or more BEM use-cases (e.g., Building Information\r\nModel-to-BEM, model input calibration, quality assurance), any building or\r\nproject type (e.g., new or existing, commercial or residential, individual\r\nbuilding or campus), and any approach (e.g., physics-based, data-driven,\r\nhybrid). Although DOE funds the development of a number open-source\r\nphysics-based BEM tools and packages, use of DOE-funded BEM tools is not\r\nrequired.  Applicants should explicitly state which existing tools (in whole or\r\nin part) they will be using and which (if any) they plan to develop as part of\r\nthe proposed work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterested applicants may refer to\r\nBTO’s draft research & development opportunities document for more\r\ninformation about specific barriers to the effective adoption of BEM and\r\npossible initiatives to address them [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Amir Roth, Amir.Roth@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Solid-State\r\nLighting Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits R&D\r\nproposals for innovative solutions in advanced solid-state lighting\r\ntechnologies (SSL). There are three subtopic areas of interest for Lighting\r\nR&D. Please note that awards may not be made in all areas, and the\r\ndistribution will depend on the number and quality of proposals received. In\r\nall cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the\r\nproposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology\r\ncapabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.\r\nFor more information on these topics, applicants should refer to the Lighting\r\nResearch and Development Opportunities document [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.      SSL\r\nTechnology development – DOE seeks product- and market-facing technology\r\ndevelopment that achieves energy savings in addition to the 2019 baseline or\r\nadvanced functionality based on the features of SSL technology. Gains in energy\r\nsavings and new functionality can be achieved through optical delivery,\r\nintensity controls, source and fixture efficiency, and spectral optimization.\r\nExamples of product or technology advancement include energy savings in SSL applications\r\ninclude, but are not limited to, general illumination, increased productivity,\r\nenhanced well-being, safety improvements, and reduced environmental\r\nimpacts. \r\n\r\n2.      Manufacturing\r\nTechnologies and Materials for SSL –DOE seeks additive and sustainable manufacturing\r\ntechniques and materials for SSL for all portions of the value chain. These\r\ntechniques should enable manufacturing at scale for a wide variety of product\r\nconfigurations with reduced component count, inventory, and production time\r\nwith potential for reduced cost. Also relevant are advancements in product\r\ndesigns and materials that advance the capabilities of additive and/or\r\nsustainable manufacturing without degrading performance or lifetime of\r\nluminaries. Materials should reduce the embodied energy of the luminaire and\r\nshould be readily recycled, reused, or repurposed. This subtopic supports\r\nDOE’s crosscutting emphasis to enable advancements in Advanced Manufacturing as\r\npart of the Administration’s emphasis strengthening U.S. leadership in the\r\nIndustries of the Future; however, SBIR applicants for lighting-specific\r\nmanufacturing should apply to this topic.\r\n\r\n3.      SSL\r\nMaterial Science – DOE seeks research to advance understanding of SSL\r\ndegradation mechanisms, carrier dynamics, performance under different operating\r\nregimes, photon generation and control, and downconverter properties. Research\r\nshould advance the understanding of material-performance relationships for SSL\r\ntechnologies to enable energy saving and performance enhancement, in a way that\r\nimproves the technology’s commercial applications.

In all cases, project benefits should be demonstrated and validated as part of the proposed project structure, and clear demonstration of product or technology capabilities is required for consideration for advancement to Phase II funding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, all proposals to this topic must:\r\n\r\n·         Propose a tightly structured program which includes advanced building construction-relevant technical milestones that demonstrate clear progress, are aggressive but achievable, and are quantitative.\r\n\r\n·         Provide evidence that the proposer has relevant advanced building construction experience and capability.\r\n\r\n·         Include projections for cost and/or performance improvements that are tied to a clearly defined baseline and/or state of the art products or practices.\r\n\r\n·         Explicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation with respect to existing commercially available products or solutions.\r\n\r\n·         Include an energy savings impact as well as a preliminary cost analysis.\r\n\r\n·         Report all relevant performance metrics.\r\n\r\n·         Justify all performance claims with theoretical predictions and/or relevant experimental data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must be responsive to the following subtopics. Applications outside of these subtopic areas will not be considered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Diagnostic Technologies and Tools\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for innovative technologies and tools critical for design and manufacturing of retrofit solutions for buildings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnologies that can characterize the key energy and moisture performance-related properties of existing opaque envelopes could facilitate retrofit adoption and aid offsite manufacturing by quantifying the benefit of retrofits, pinpointing specific areas to retrofit, determining if an envelope retrofit can be safely conducted, and verifying post-retrofit performance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNovel nondestructive testing and sensing technologies; simplified, lower-cost physical testing platforms; and novel, low-computational expense data acquisition and synthesis software have the potential to significantly expand the impact and reach of envelope diagnostic technologies. For more information, applicants should review BTO’s DRAFT Research and Development Opportunities Report for Opaque Building Envelopes [1] and ASHRAE’s Review of Non-Destructive Techniques for Building Diagnostic Inspections [2]. Proposals must include supporting data acquisition and processing software that delivers actionable insights to testing personnel. All solutions should minimize setup and teardown effort and time, as well as avoid disruption to building operations or occupants during testing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecifically, DOE seeks proposals in areas that include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel air leakage diagnostic metrology that delivers accurate and fast results regardless of outdoor weather conditions and provides location and quantified extent of infiltration/exfiltration. Technologies that reduce the complexity and effort required to test medium and large commercial buildings are also of interest.\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel diagnostic metrology for envelope moisture performance without needing to remove exterior cladding. Detection of pre-existing moisture and water intrusion issues within envelopes (e.g., exterior wall assemblies) is an important step when considering envelope retrofits, such as those envisioned by BTO’s ABC Initiative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sven Mumme, sven.mumme@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Low-cost, High-R Insulation\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for development of low-cost, high-R factor insulation (targeting under $0.05/inch*R and no greater than $1/square foot per inch) using readily available and scalable manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed solutions should be compatible with existing tooling at the construction site or incorporate a substantial change in installation method that yields lower overall cost, labor effort, and installation time.\r\n\r\nHigh R-value per inch insulation materials that could reduce the cost and complexity of envelope retrofits could make façade retrofits of existing buildings much more feasible and accessible. For more information, applicants should read BTO’s DRAFT: Research and Development Opportunities Report for Opaque Building Envelopes report [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals for sustainable insulation material innovations must meet the cost target and have an R-value/inch of 8 or greater are of interest. Potential areas of for research and development include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n·         Development of durable aerogel insulation using continuous, high-throughput production methods (e.g., in bead form, 3D printing, etc.) at atmospheric processing conditions and in practical building insulation form factors. Aerogels often are very brittle, use very expensive material feedstocks, and utilize complex and expensive manufacturing processes. DOE seeks innovations that result in significant cost reductions of 3-5 times compared to current aerogel costs.\r\n\r\n·         Development of durable, ultralow-cost vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) using high-throughput production methods. VIPs are often regarded as one of the most promising state-of-the-art building insulation solutions given their potential to achieve ultra-low thermal conductivities. While commercially available, VIPs are very expensive, relegating them to niche applications. To make VIPs truly affordable for the building sector, costs need to be cut by a factor of >3-5 times current VIP cost. Dialing back the thermal performance (e.g., to whole panel thermal resistance of R10-15/inch), for instance, could offer extra degrees of freedom on the material, barrier film, vacuum creation, and processing side to enable new cost curves and deliver truly low-cost VIPs.\r\n\r\n·         Development of novel form insulation (spray foam and rigid foam board) that offer improved insulation values at comparable costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Sven Mumme, sven.mumme@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Advanced Building Equipment Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for the design of new energy efficient advanced building equipment technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe ABC Initiative focuses on several key areas for building equipment technologies. HVAC and water heating technologies influence the design of new buildings and retrofit opportunities, and by taking these technologies into consideration will allow DOE to expand the ABC R&D portfolio beyond existing state-of-the art integrated heat pump (IHP) solutions. DOE is particularly interested in proposals that leverage previous building equipment R&D to make solutions that are relevant to ABC. For example, IHP technology and multi-functional space-conditioning unit with water heating function can facilitate whole-building, deep energy retrofits in the residential sector by integrating the solution into the building itself, like variable refrigerant flow systems. These technologies lead to significant energy savings (greater than 50%) by recovering condensing waste heat in the cooling season and providing dedicated or desuperheating heat pump water heating. This type of heat exchanger utilizes the high temperature of the superheated refrigerant gas to heat water. For more information, applicants should read BTO’s Energy Savings Potential and RD&D Opportunities for Non-Vapor-Compression HVAC Technologies report [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals in the following specific areas:\r\n\r\n·         Energy and work recovery technologies that significantly advance the state-of-the-art for HVAC and water heating equipment. DOE is particularly interested in technologies that do not rely on passive and expensive materials but could use active (non-vapor compression) technology to transfer waste heat for preheating use. Applicants must demonstrate how the technologies could be incorporated into equipment design.\r\n\r\n·         New approaches, technologies, and concepts that address air and water distribution systems with improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGiven the wide range of ABC building equipment technologies suitable for this subtopic, specific cost targets are not defined in the subtopic; however, applications must outline expected costs of the proposed design, providing analysis to support claims made. Applicants should also consider system approaches at the whole building level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must demonstrate greater than or equal to 30 percent energy efficiency as compared to state-of-the-art or Energy Star equipment, little to no increase in physical size, or little to no increase in difficulty to clean to maintain as-new performance as compared to state-of-the-art or Energy Star equipment, as well as a payback period less than or equal to 5 years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of product or technology advancement include energy savings in HVAC and water applications, including but not limited to general discrete HVAC and water heating equipment, increased productivity, enhanced comfort, and reduced environmental impacts. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Fredericka Brown, Fredericka.brown@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Advanced Building Construction Digitization Solutions\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals that identify and encourage development of innovative information technology solutions that support the objectives of the ABC Initiative and construction digitization, including but not limited to, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAccording to a 2017 report by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the construction industry and its associated manufacturing sector sorely underinvest in the technology and digital tools that would enable significant productivity gains [1]. MGI analysis suggests that lower digitization in the construction industry has contributed to productivity decline, which leads to cost/price escalation, which in turn is a well-documented deterrent to energy efficiency measure adoption. BTO believes that increased digitization and improved construction productivity will lower barriers to energy efficiency and building performance improvements, increase building affordability, and improve building reliability.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComplex software and faster computing power, combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning, allow for the rapid intake and processing of information. For energy-efficient construction, machines can intake visual images, energy analysis and modeling, and other inputs to directly translate data into the fabrication of building components including walls, roofs, or interior design features. This process, also known colloquially as \"art-to-part,\" can help bridge the gap between a traditional building and a high-performance building with smarter, energy-efficient components.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch areas being considered under this topic include but are not limited to “Building Information Modeling (BIM) to fabrication” applications, construction process digitization for process improvement (4D/5D CAD applications), automated QA/QC applications, and automated Building Commissioning solutions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreference will be given to technology solutions that are applicable to both new and existing buildings. While modest feasibility studies are appropriate for Phase I funding, applications for this subtopic should be transitioning to manufacturing by Phase II to be considered for further funding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Eric Werling, eric.werling@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

The\r\nmission of HFTO is to conduct research, development and innovation to enable\r\nthe adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across multiple\r\napplications and sectors at scale. To achieve this goal, HFTO invests in\r\ninnovative technologies that show promise in harnessing American energy\r\nresources safely and efficiently. Fuel cells can address our critical energy\r\nchallenges in all sectors – commercial, residential, industrial, and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fuel can be produced from diverse domestic\r\nresources, such as natural gas, coal, and biomass, as well as from renewables\r\nusing methods such as direct or indirect water splitting.    Hydrogen fuel\r\ncells are an attractive technology to power zero-emissions medium- and\r\nheavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, as well as marine, rail, mining,\r\nand aviation applications. They offer several advantages over incumbent\r\ntechnologies: higher efficiency, reduced emissions, higher torque, and no noise\r\npollution. Additionally, they offer fast fueling and adequate fuel storage for\r\napplications demanding longer range.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe HFTO program funds research and development to address\r\nkey technical challenges for both fuel cells and hydrogen fuels (production,\r\ndelivery, and storage) with medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications as an\r\nemerging area of focus.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications submitted to any of these subtopics must: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nPropose a tightly structured program including technical\r\nmilestones that demonstrate clear progress, are aggressive but achievable, and\r\nare quantitative; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude projections for cost and/or performance improvements that\r\nare tied to a baseline; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nExplicitly and thoroughly differentiate the proposed innovation\r\nwith respect to existing commercially available products or solutions; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nInclude a preliminary cost analysis and justify all performance\r\nclaims with theoretical predictions and/or relevant experimental data. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are sought only in the following subtopics: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      Novel\r\nPEM Fuel Cell Membrane Electrode Assemblies for High Efficiency and Durability\r\nin Heavy Duty Applications \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for novel and innovative concepts that advance the\r\ndevelopment and integration of electrocatalysts, membranes, ionomers, and/or\r\ngas diffusion layers for use in heavy-duty direct hydrogen polymer electrolyte\r\nmembrane (PEM) fuel cells, with a focus on high durability and high fuel\r\nefficiency. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMedium- and heavy-duty PEM fuel\r\ncell electric vehicles operating on hydrogen offer several advantages over\r\nincumbent technologies, including higher efficiency, reduced emissions, higher\r\ntorque, and no noise pollution.  Medium- and heavy-duty truck applications\r\nrequire a lifetime of up to one million miles, and therefore require fuel cells\r\nwith innovative membrane, catalyst, and electrode structures with enhanced\r\ndurability. Significantly longer vehicle lifetimes and range requirements also\r\nmean that hydrogen fuel costs comprise a greater proportion of vehicle\r\nlifecycle cost. As such, increased fuel cell efficiency is a key parameter for\r\neconomic viability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe heart of the PEM fuel cell is\r\nthe membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs rely on expensive Platinum Group\r\nMetals (PGM) as catalysts within the electrodes. A critical path to reducing\r\nfuel cell cost, in support of DOE’s Critical Minerals Initiative, is to reduce\r\nthe amount of PGMs used in fuel cells, while maintaining fuel cell durability\r\nand efficiency.  For state-of-the-art MEAs, durability and power output\r\ndecreases with lower PGM loading. This makes it difficult to meet 2030 DOE\r\ntarget of 25,000 hours durability for medium- and heavy-duty transportation\r\napplications while simultaneously meeting targets for system cost ($80/kW) and\r\nefficiency (68% peak) [1]. In the most demanding applications, the conditions\r\ninclude operation in the presence of fuel and air impurities, starting and\r\nstopping, freezing and thawing, and humidity and load cycling that result in\r\nmechanical and chemical stresses on fuel cell materials, components, and\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo expedite heavy-duty fuel cell\r\ncompetitiveness, the DOE launched the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium\r\n(M2FCT), which includes national labs in partnership with universities and\r\nindustry to accelerate R&D that would enable meeting a fuel cell durability\r\nof a million miles. M2FCT is a large-scale, comprehensive effort to enable widespread\r\ncommercialization of fuel cells for heavy duty applications. The M2FCT\r\ncross-disciplinary fuel cell R&D Consortium is focused on achieving\r\naggressive targets for fuel cell MEAs that meet efficiency, durability, and\r\ncost [2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesigns for fuel cell MEAs submitted\r\nin response to this subtopic should demonstrate significant progress toward\r\nmeeting the M2FCT  2025 MEA target of 2.5 kW/gPGM power output (1.07 A/cm2\r\ncurrent density at 0.7 V, <0.3 mg/cm2 PGM loading) after running a\r\nheavy-duty accelerated stress test equivalent to 25,000 hours.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, applications must\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of any novel low-PGM cathode oxygen reduction catalyst\r\nsynthesis, novel membrane synthesis, improved gas diffusion and ionomer\r\nmaterials, and electrode layer design and integration;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach improves durability and efficiency of\r\nlow-cost fuel cells under realistic conditions; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach decreases degradation in new and\r\nstate-of-the-art material sets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should provide\r\nsubstantial evidence that the proposed MEA design and materials represent a\r\nsignificant improvement in efficiency and/or durability over state-of-the-art\r\nPEMFC MEAs that are used in current fuel cell vehicle applications. Applicants\r\nshould collaborate with M2FCT where possible, including testing and utilizing\r\nappropriate accelerated stress tests (ASTs). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Donna Ho, Donna.Ho@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      Innovative\r\nApproaches to Minimize Boil-off Losses from Liquid Hydrogen Storage Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor novel concepts, ranging from component level to system scale, that\r\nsubstantially mitigate, recapture, or beneficially use boil-off from either\r\nbulk stationary storage of liquid hydrogen, transfers of liquid hydrogen, or\r\nliquid hydrogen storage systems onboard transportation vessels, such that boil\r\noff is less than 0.1%. Examples include but are not limited to development of\r\nnovel materials and components that manage heat transfer from liquid equipment,\r\nconcepts to capture and recover boil-off vapor, and innovative integration of\r\nstation components (e.g., cryo-pumps and liquid dewars).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen is transported and stored\r\nin liquid form in applications where demand is significant and stable, but\r\nwhere overall regional hydrogen demand is not large enough to warrant the use\r\nof pipelines. Sectors that use liquid hydrogen include space applications,\r\nindustrial facilities (e.g. metal processing plants), and fueling stations for\r\nhydrogen vehicles and material handling equipment. Given the exceptionally low\r\nboiling point of liquid hydrogen (20 K), boil-off losses throughout the\r\ndelivery pathway, which includes trucking, offloading to a facility, storage\r\nand use of the liquid hydrogen at the facility, can be a substantial cost\r\ncontributor. Mitigation of these boil-off losses will become increasingly\r\nimportant as newer applications for liquid hydrogen emerge, e.g. in heavy-duty\r\ntransportation, marine vessels, and rail vessels where hydrogen may be stored\r\nonboard in liquid form. These applications will require a wide range of onboard\r\nliquid hydrogen storage capacities, from around 60 kg for long-haul Class 8\r\ntrucks, to thousands of kgs for larger marine vessels. Boil-off losses in these\r\nuse cases are intimately tied to dormancy and duty cycles and could be just as\r\nsignificant as those present in refueling stations. Strategies to eliminate the\r\nboil-off of fuels in general have been explored in many other industries to\r\ndate, including the aerospace and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sectors.\r\nApproaches that have been studied include innovative methods of insulation,\r\nmixing of layers within liquid dewars to prevent stratification, use of\r\ncryo-coolers, recovery of boil-off to power ancillary equipment, and\r\nsophisticated cryo-pump designs. Many of these approaches are\r\ncapital-intensive, which prohibits their widespread use and would hinder any\r\nability to achieve HFTO’s hydrogen cost targets. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the effort is expected\r\nto involve an in-depth analysis that includes a preliminary design of the\r\nselected component(s) or strategy, as well as specific research, development,\r\nand (if reasonable within the Phase I budget) proof-of-concept testing of any\r\nnew components or processes to show that they have the potential to be\r\nincorporated into a liquid hydrogen storage system. Phase II should focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at a scale relevant to demonstrate the\r\nviability of the concept for the specific application or use case being\r\ntargeted. Identification of commercialization strategies and a market analysis\r\nshould also be included. Identification of potential commercialization\r\npartners, with indication of commitment, would greatly strengthen Phase II\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Zeric Hulvey,\r\nZeric.Hulvey@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       In-line\r\nFilter for Particulate Matter at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic seeks concepts that can remove particulate contaminants from hydrogen\r\nfuel at fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fueling stations for fuel\r\ncell vehicles conventionally use filters to prevent particulate matter from\r\ncontaminating the vehicle [1]. Limits for particulate matter in hydrogen fuel\r\nfor vehicles have been established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\r\nJ2719 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14687\r\nstandards.[2] Per SAE J2719, particulate matter must be limited to 1 mg/kg H2,\r\nand 99% of particulates larger than 5 micrometers should be removed before\r\nreaching a vehicle.[3] Filters that meet SAE J2719 requirements are available\r\nfor light duty vehicle fueling stations, where the peak flow rate is less than\r\n2 kg/min. However, filters that can support the need to fill at the higher flow\r\nrates (60 kg or more in approximately 6-10 minutes), needed for fueling medium-\r\n(MD) and heavy-duty (HD) vehicles, are not commercially available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed filter concepts must be\r\ncapable of continuous operation at -40°C and pressures of 700-1,000 bar. The\r\nunit design should account for any occurring pressure drop due to the\r\nfiltration. The unit developed must be capable of installation within a\r\nhydrogen dispenser, and potentially, at multiple points in the fueling system\r\n(e.g. between compressor stages) to mitigate the consequences of failure. The\r\nunit must be capable of an average flow rate of approximately 10 kg H2/min [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should include\r\nconcept development and feasibility evaluation of filter materials and design\r\nfor key metrics, including durability under 1,000 bar pressure and -40°C\r\ntemperature, and ability to meet SAE J2719 particulate requirements. Further, the\r\nresistance across the filter should not generate sufficient pressure drop to\r\nimpact the desired flow rate and dispensing pressures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase II proposals will involve\r\nincorporation of the filter design into a device that should additionally be\r\neasily field replaceable, and validation of the device. Phase II proposals must\r\nidentify service life and provide criteria for filter replacement. Concepts\r\nproposed should target a capital cost of $500 or less. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Efficient\r\nChillers for Hydrogen Pre-cooling at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor R&D of novel concepts that will allow for maximum hydrogen refueling of\r\nmedium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) vehicles compared with traditional fuel routes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterest in the use of fuel cells\r\nonboard MD/HD vehicles is growing rapidly, due to their potential to enable\r\nhigh-power operation, long range, and zero emissions. Deployment of MD/HD fuel\r\ncell vehicles will require the development of novel hydrogen fueling\r\ntechnologies that can enable fills that are over five times faster than those\r\nof light-duty hydrogen fueling stations. While a fueling protocol for MD/HD\r\nfuel cell vehicles has not yet been established, the DOE’s target for hydrogen\r\nfueling of 700 bar onboard storage tanks include a fill rate of 10 kg/min with\r\na hydrogen gas temperature of -40 °C [1]. Hydrogen chillers that can achieve\r\n-40 °C fills are commercially available, but do not meet the flow rate and\r\ncooling capacity requirements of MD/HD vehicles. Cooling capacities of up to\r\n100 kW will be necessary to facilitate 10 kg/min refueling at -40 °C.[2]   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed concepts must adhere to\r\nthe flow rate and temperature standards of 10 kg/min (maximum) and -33 °C\r\nat the point of dispensing within 30 seconds; however, viable alternatives to\r\ntemperature standards will be considered. Proposed concepts can range in scope\r\nfrom component to system level. Examples include, but are not limited to,\r\nchillers that enable on-demand supply of cold hydrogen, short-term intermediate\r\ncold storage, and systems that circumvent hydrogen precooling. Proposed\r\nconcepts should be applicable for use of either gaseous or liquid on-site bulk\r\nstorage of hydrogen, however on-site hydrogen liquefaction concepts will not be\r\nconsidered for this subtopic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the project is expected\r\nto focus on an in-depth analysis of the system or component(s) proposed,\r\nrefueling protocol efficiency and overall costs. Testing protocols, including\r\nsafety, should also be established as a part of Phase I. Phase II will focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at the laboratory scale.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.

In the most demanding applications, the conditions\r\ninclude operation in the presence of fuel and air impurities, starting and\r\nstopping, freezing and thawing, and humidity and load cycling that result in\r\nmechanical and chemical stresses on fuel cell materials, components, and\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo expedite heavy-duty fuel cell\r\ncompetitiveness, the DOE launched the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium\r\n(M2FCT), which includes national labs in partnership with universities and\r\nindustry to accelerate R&D that would enable meeting a fuel cell durability\r\nof a million miles. M2FCT is a large-scale, comprehensive effort to enable widespread\r\ncommercialization of fuel cells for heavy duty applications. The M2FCT\r\ncross-disciplinary fuel cell R&D Consortium is focused on achieving\r\naggressive targets for fuel cell MEAs that meet efficiency, durability, and\r\ncost [2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesigns for fuel cell MEAs submitted\r\nin response to this subtopic should demonstrate significant progress toward\r\nmeeting the M2FCT  2025 MEA target of 2.5 kW/gPGM power output (1.07 A/cm2\r\ncurrent density at 0.7 V, <0.3 mg/cm2 PGM loading) after running a\r\nheavy-duty accelerated stress test equivalent to 25,000 hours.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, applications must\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of any novel low-PGM cathode oxygen reduction catalyst\r\nsynthesis, novel membrane synthesis, improved gas diffusion and ionomer\r\nmaterials, and electrode layer design and integration;\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach improves durability and efficiency of\r\nlow-cost fuel cells under realistic conditions; and\r\n\r\n·        \r\nDetails of how the approach decreases degradation in new and\r\nstate-of-the-art material sets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should provide\r\nsubstantial evidence that the proposed MEA design and materials represent a\r\nsignificant improvement in efficiency and/or durability over state-of-the-art\r\nPEMFC MEAs that are used in current fuel cell vehicle applications.

"subtopic_description": "b.      Innovative\r\nApproaches to Minimize Boil-off Losses from Liquid Hydrogen Storage Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor novel concepts, ranging from component level to system scale, that\r\nsubstantially mitigate, recapture, or beneficially use boil-off from either\r\nbulk stationary storage of liquid hydrogen, transfers of liquid hydrogen, or\r\nliquid hydrogen storage systems onboard transportation vessels, such that boil\r\noff is less than 0.1%. Examples include but are not limited to development of\r\nnovel materials and components that manage heat transfer from liquid equipment,\r\nconcepts to capture and recover boil-off vapor, and innovative integration of\r\nstation components (e.g., cryo-pumps and liquid dewars).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen is transported and stored\r\nin liquid form in applications where demand is significant and stable, but\r\nwhere overall regional hydrogen demand is not large enough to warrant the use\r\nof pipelines. Sectors that use liquid hydrogen include space applications,\r\nindustrial facilities (e.g. metal processing plants), and fueling stations for\r\nhydrogen vehicles and material handling equipment. Given the exceptionally low\r\nboiling point of liquid hydrogen (20 K), boil-off losses throughout the\r\ndelivery pathway, which includes trucking, offloading to a facility, storage\r\nand use of the liquid hydrogen at the facility, can be a substantial cost\r\ncontributor. Mitigation of these boil-off losses will become increasingly\r\nimportant as newer applications for liquid hydrogen emerge, e.g. in heavy-duty\r\ntransportation, marine vessels, and rail vessels where hydrogen may be stored\r\nonboard in liquid form. These applications will require a wide range of onboard\r\nliquid hydrogen storage capacities, from around 60 kg for long-haul Class 8\r\ntrucks, to thousands of kgs for larger marine vessels. Boil-off losses in these\r\nuse cases are intimately tied to dormancy and duty cycles and could be just as\r\nsignificant as those present in refueling stations. Strategies to eliminate the\r\nboil-off of fuels in general have been explored in many other industries to\r\ndate, including the aerospace and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sectors.\r\nApproaches that have been studied include innovative methods of insulation,\r\nmixing of layers within liquid dewars to prevent stratification, use of\r\ncryo-coolers, recovery of boil-off to power ancillary equipment, and\r\nsophisticated cryo-pump designs. Many of these approaches are\r\ncapital-intensive, which prohibits their widespread use and would hinder any\r\nability to achieve HFTO’s hydrogen cost targets. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the effort is expected\r\nto involve an in-depth analysis that includes a preliminary design of the\r\nselected component(s) or strategy, as well as specific research, development,\r\nand (if reasonable within the Phase I budget) proof-of-concept testing of any\r\nnew components or processes to show that they have the potential to be\r\nincorporated into a liquid hydrogen storage system. Phase II should focus on\r\nprototype development and testing at a scale relevant to demonstrate the\r\nviability of the concept for the specific application or use case being\r\ntargeted. Identification of commercialization strategies and a market analysis\r\nshould also be included. Identification of potential commercialization\r\npartners, with indication of commitment, would greatly strengthen Phase II\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Zeric Hulvey,\r\nZeric.Hulvey@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

"subtopic_description": "c.       In-line\r\nFilter for Particulate Matter at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic seeks concepts that can remove particulate contaminants from hydrogen\r\nfuel at fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen fueling stations for fuel\r\ncell vehicles conventionally use filters to prevent particulate matter from\r\ncontaminating the vehicle [1]. Limits for particulate matter in hydrogen fuel\r\nfor vehicles have been established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)\r\nJ2719 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14687\r\nstandards.[2] Per SAE J2719, particulate matter must be limited to 1 mg/kg H2,\r\nand 99% of particulates larger than 5 micrometers should be removed before\r\nreaching a vehicle.[3] Filters that meet SAE J2719 requirements are available\r\nfor light duty vehicle fueling stations, where the peak flow rate is less than\r\n2 kg/min. However, filters that can support the need to fill at the higher flow\r\nrates (60 kg or more in approximately 6-10 minutes), needed for fueling medium-\r\n(MD) and heavy-duty (HD) vehicles, are not commercially available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed filter concepts must be\r\ncapable of continuous operation at -40°C and pressures of 700-1,000 bar. The\r\nunit design should account for any occurring pressure drop due to the\r\nfiltration. The unit developed must be capable of installation within a\r\nhydrogen dispenser, and potentially, at multiple points in the fueling system\r\n(e.g. between compressor stages) to mitigate the consequences of failure. The\r\nunit must be capable of an average flow rate of approximately 10 kg H2/min [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I proposals should include\r\nconcept development and feasibility evaluation of filter materials and design\r\nfor key metrics, including durability under 1,000 bar pressure and -40°C\r\ntemperature, and ability to meet SAE J2719 particulate requirements. Further, the\r\nresistance across the filter should not generate sufficient pressure drop to\r\nimpact the desired flow rate and dispensing pressures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase II proposals will involve\r\nincorporation of the filter design into a device that should additionally be\r\neasily field replaceable, and validation of the device. Phase II proposals must\r\nidentify service life and provide criteria for filter replacement. Concepts\r\nproposed should target a capital cost of $500 or less. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Neha Rustagi,\r\nNeha.Rustagi@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",

Efficient\r\nChillers for Hydrogen Pre-cooling at Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fueling Stations \r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nfor R&D of novel concepts that will allow for maximum hydrogen refueling of\r\nmedium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) vehicles compared with traditional fuel routes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterest in the use of fuel cells\r\nonboard MD/HD vehicles is growing rapidly, due to their potential to enable\r\nhigh-power operation, long range, and zero emissions. Deployment of MD/HD fuel\r\ncell vehicles will require the development of novel hydrogen fueling\r\ntechnologies that can enable fills that are over five times faster than those\r\nof light-duty hydrogen fueling stations. While a fueling protocol for MD/HD\r\nfuel cell vehicles has not yet been established, the DOE’s target for hydrogen\r\nfueling of 700 bar onboard storage tanks include a fill rate of 10 kg/min with\r\na hydrogen gas temperature of -40 °C [1]. Hydrogen chillers that can achieve\r\n-40 °C fills are commercially available, but do not meet the flow rate and\r\ncooling capacity requirements of MD/HD vehicles. Cooling capacities of up to\r\n100 kW will be necessary to facilitate 10 kg/min refueling at -40 °C.[2]   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposed concepts must adhere to\r\nthe flow rate and temperature standards of 10 kg/min (maximum) and -33 °C\r\nat the point of dispensing within 30 seconds; however, viable alternatives to\r\ntemperature standards will be considered. Proposed concepts can range in scope\r\nfrom component to system level. Examples include, but are not limited to,\r\nchillers that enable on-demand supply of cold hydrogen, short-term intermediate\r\ncold storage, and systems that circumvent hydrogen precooling. Proposed\r\nconcepts should be applicable for use of either gaseous or liquid on-site bulk\r\nstorage of hydrogen, however on-site hydrogen liquefaction concepts will not be\r\nconsidered for this subtopic. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhase I of the project is expected\r\nto focus on an in-depth analysis of the system or component(s) proposed,\r\nrefueling protocol efficiency and overall costs.

Applications on technologies related to PV electrical connections will be considered nonresponsive if submitted to this topic (Topic 16, Solar Energy Technologies).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications are sought in the following subtopics:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\na.      TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Method for Mechanical Load Testing of Photovoltaic Modules with Concurrently Applied Stressors and Diagnostic Methods\r\n\r\nThis is a Technology Transfer Opportunity for a non-exclusive license to commercialize a newly developed and PV module testing platform that allows for simultaneous application of multiple stress factors of the natural environment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComprehensive design testing of PV modules is challenging. Typically, stresses at levels higher than those occurring in the natural environment are applied to achieve acceleration. These stress factors are usually applied in steady state, with fewer stress factors, or in combinations and sequences that do not reflect real world conditions. Also, stress tests are frequently designed around failure modes in existing designs that have already manifested in the field, limiting our ability to predict the potential occurrence of failures with new PV module materials and designs. Real-world load tests – required for modules in environments in which high wind or snow loading is commonplace – are difficult to replicate because currently used techniques cannot replicate the high frequency module vibration experienced in high winds while also thermally stressing the module, allowing for water ingress, and allowing exposure to light. Current methods for applying mechanical load to a module for mechanical testing obstruct significant amount of light from at least one side of the module whereas open rack systems, especially for bifacial modules, are designed for exposure to light from both faces of the module. While each of the stress factors are frequently applied in isolation, no current test for full size commercial PV modules can replicate the combination of stress factors as occurs in the natural environment in which they have been known unexpectedly fail, in part because of the limitation of commonly used stress tests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a PV module testing platform to simultaneously apply multiple stress factors of the natural environment (light, heat, moisture, system voltage, and mechanical stress) to achieve a comprehensive test of module durability. The simulation applies levels corresponding to the extremes of the conditions found in the natural environment using a four-cell mini module platform. We seek the scale up and commercialization of a system for full size modules with these five stress factors, including a system that applies an oscillating mechanical load to the edges of a PV module in such a way so as to avoid obstructing the active cell area. To achieve this, the module can be vibrated at its mounting points so that the interior of the module is rapidly displaced by its own momentum. Avoiding the obstruction of light this way, additional stressors including light, heat, moisture would be simultaneously applied the active area of the module such that they me be monitored by optical or electro-optical means to evaluate any module degradation in-situ. NREL is currently looking for partners to help with prototyping and commercialization of the combined- accelerated stress testing system for the evaluation of durability of full-size commercial PV modules.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: National Renewable Energy Laboratory\r\n\r\nContact: Bill Hadley; bill.hadley@nrel.gov; (303) 275 3015\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive\r\n\r\nPatent Status: Pending\r\n\r\nNREL tracking number: 19-64\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.      TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Nanocomposite Barrier Films for Photovoltaic Applications\r\n\r\nThis Technology Transfer Opportunity solicits interested companies to license a newly developed and patented thin film coating that can be used as an encapsulant for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coating in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPolymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN) thin film coatings have improved water vapor and oxygen permeability, in addition to improved corrosion resistance, while retaining high transparency, high electrical resistivity, and excellent fire-retardant properties for use as encapsulants for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coatings in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn these unique composite materials, repeated sequential deposition of solutions of clays (vermiculite, montmorillonite, etc.) and solutions of polymers (polyethylenimine,  poly(acrylic acid, etc.) layer with complimentary charged functional groups (positive and negative) forms a coating.  The coating can be deposited with many various repeating schemes as it is built one layer at a time. Once cured, the microstructure resembles a brick and mortar system where the clay platelets are the “bricks” and the polymer is the ”mortar”. The facile and scalable layer-by-layer processing is applicable to many substrates, from porous and flexible items such as fabrics and foams to hard dense materials such as glass or ceramics. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs an impermeable barrier, the structure dictates a tortuous path for oxygen or water molecules to follow, which decreases the water transmission rate by over an order of magnitude beyond ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). During a fire, the applied composite coating reduces the heat rate release, and can act as a flame retardant system. In an arcing electrical system, the PCN coating promotes extinguishment and increases time to flame by as much as 300%.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSandia National Laboratories Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: Sandia National Laboratories\r\n\r\nContact: Margaret Gordon, megord@sandia.gov\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive\r\n\r\nPatent Status: Active - https://patents.google.com/patent/US10002983B1/\r\n\r\nPublication date: 06/19/2018\r\n\r\nFiling date: 05/24/2017\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Floating Solar-Powered Aeration Systems\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks innovations that can advance the application of floating solar-powered aeration systems (FSAS) to improve water quality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAeration is the introduction of air into aquatic systems to support the growth of aerobic bacteria and aquatic life. Facilitating the oxidative decomposition of biological materials, aeration can also remove the gaseous products of decomposition, including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Many natural systems depend upon aeration to maintain a diversity of animal and plant species, as well as overall health. However, a surplus of nutrients, restricted mixing and flow, or significant depth can deplete dissolved oxygen in aqueous systems [1, 2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArtificial aeration has been developed to address this issue. As a technology, aeration is generally applied to establish, maintain, or restore sufficient dissolved oxygen to ensure successful remediation and protection of water resources, including natural bodies of water (e.g., rivers, lakes) and artificial ones (e.g., fish farms, lagoons) [2]. Recently, self-powered, autonomous units that combine floating photovoltaics and aeration have been implemented to help restore natural water resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications should fall within one of the following three broad areas for ecosystem management on water systems:\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for environmental restoration and protection of natural water systems [1, 2];\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for sustainable water systems for aquaculture [3];\r\n\r\n·         FSAS for sustainable waste bio-processing water systems [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications for FSAS outside these three categories will be considered if they focus on aeration via a floating solar-powered system. Applications should describe aeration parameters such as depth, timing, and rate of aeration; electrical-system specifics such as power requirements, electrical storage, and control systems; and any other subsystems in sufficient detail to explain the innovation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSETO is particularly interested in applications developing technologies that:\r\n\r\n·         Reduce operating costs by using FSAS to improve water quality;\r\n\r\n·         Reduce the balance-of-system costs of an FSAS;\r\n\r\n·         Improve the effectiveness and operation of FSAS;\r\n\r\n·         Build synergy between FSAS and other unit operations to add value via enhanced system functionality; and\r\n\r\n·         Generate an excess of electricity beyond that needed for aeration to provide power for external electrical systems (either floating, submerged, or shore-based).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Solar Systems Resilient to Weather-related or Cyber Threats\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks innovative proposals to improve the ability of solar assets or electronic devices associated with solar energy generation (such as inverters, direct current (DC)-DC optimizers, and smart meters) and systems to quickly recover in response to weather-related or cyber threats [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of SETO’s priorities is to enhance the ability of solar energy technologies to contribute to grid reliability and resilience, including the security and resilience of the nation’s critical infrastructure. Infrastructure systems, including the electrical grid and solar generation assets, are vulnerable to weather-related threats, cyberattacks, and other disruptive events. Increased asset resilience presents opportunities to maximize operability and energy availability and minimize restoration costs following these occurrences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications to this subtopic may address specific component or system designs that improve survival; improve recovery time; ensure access control, confidentiality, integrity, availability, or non-repudiation of assets; and minimize cost associated with disruptive events. Component or system designs may achieve these goals passively (e.g., via more robust designs or configurations) or actively (e.g., via “hardened” components, including any component that is connected in a smart power systems injection/absorption role).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a basic cost-model analysis showing the cost/benefit of the proposed solution in comparison to current state of the art. Proposed solutions should discuss the component(s) being addressed, potential threats that will be deterred, method of integration (especially clarifying if it is part of a traditional PV component for integration at install or a retrofit for a fielded device), how interoperability with other components is considered, and how compromises or attempted compromises are conveyed to the relevant parties. Applications should also identify a possible case use by defining the time to recover the system’s full functionalities, and provide substantiated estimates for the capabilities of the proposed approach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of targets and metrics for hardened solar system performance include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Percent of system operable after a disruptive event (applications should specify type and intensity of the threat);\r\n\r\n·         Time to full system operability after extreme event (restoration time);\r\n\r\n·         Reduction in system restoration cost following disruptive event;\r\n\r\n·         Level of functionality without grid support following extreme event (islanding).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they do not demonstrate clear innovation compared to the current state of the art, particularly regarding microgrid and/or islanding behaviors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ne.      Innovation in Solar Aesthetics for Residential Photovoltaic Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for technologies that improve the aesthetic appeal of photovoltaic systems for use in residential applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile the PV market has continued to expand rapidly, the rooftop residential market has not grown at the same pace as the utility PV market, as a percentage of added capacity [1]. A survey of solar installers reported 40% of them consider aesthetics to be key when recommending which panels to install [2]. An NREL survey of potential adopters found that approximately 30% of people stopped considering PV installations due to concerns about aesthetics or the impact on the home’s resale value [3]. Another survey, of residential customers, found customers do not find currently available solar products attractive, ranking appearance a priority above reliability but below efficiency and price [4].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the installed cost per watt has remained high, mainly owing to the slower reduction in non-hardware costs for this segment of the market. This could create an opportunity where an aesthetically pleasing solar module, even with a slightly higher hardware cost, could unlock new portions of the residential market that are sensitive to appearances.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific areas of interest include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·         Innovations that greatly improve the aesthetic appeal of a PV installation\r\n\r\n·         Innovations that mask the PV installation as some other component of the home or landscaping.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they do not demonstrate clear innovation compared to the current state of the art, particularly in regard to PV module skins and PV-integrated roof shingles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nf.        Commercial and Industrial Solar Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits applications for innovative technologies that can reduce the installed cost of commercial and industrial (C&I) solar systems, improve their energy yield, facilitate their installation and grid interconnection, and enable additional value streams from them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe C&I solar market has historically trailed the utility and residential segments, and while the utility sector was up 89% year over year in the second quarter of 2020, the nonresidential sector was down 14% in the same period. Many barriers exist in C&I solar that drive that discrepancy, but there is an opportunity to develop new technologies that can enhance the value proposition. For example, the enhanced energy yield offered by tracking technology could be a game-changer in the C&I market, with its tight margins and complex transactions. Tracking technology has revolutionized the utility-scale solar sector over the past decade, with 65% of all U.S. utility-scale PV systems using single-axis tracking technology as of the end of 2019 (and 82% of U.S. utility-scale PV systems installed in 2019 using single-axis tracking technology) [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications developing technologies for solar tracking on commercial rooftops or carports are also encouraged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ng.      Agricultural Solar Systems\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can reduce the installed cost of streams from agricultural solar systems, improve the systems’ energy yield, facilitate their installation and grid interconnection, and enable additional value. Of particular interest are new system designs and technologies that optimize solar and agriculture production, which may include novel mounting and racking designs or site configurations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough land requirements for solar energy represent a small percentage of the country (92 GW of solar estimated for 2030, which is estimated to require less than 0.1% of the land in the contiguous United States), the growth in ground-mounted solar can create competition with agricultural land for land use. Co-locating solar PV and agriculture could provide diversified revenue sources and ecological benefits for agricultural enterprises while reducing land-use competition and siting restrictions. Except for growing pollinator habitat at solar facilities, the co-location of solar and agriculture is primarily limited to research sites. There are many opportunities to develop new technologies that enable agricultural production (i.e., crop or livestock production, or pollinator habitat) underneath or around solar energy systems that optimize both energy and agricultural production at co-located sites [1].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nValue streams of interest under this subtopic include, but are not limited to, increased agricultural yield and quality of life improvements, such as temperature reduction via shading. Applicants must include a strategy for future work to validate additional benefit/value streams, like crop field studies, for example.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nh.      Components for Gen3 CSP Thermal Transport Systems\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Energy Storage Grand Challenge [1], this subtopic seeks proposals for the design of components for the next generation of Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP) generation technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCSP technologies can be used to generate electricity by converting energy from sunlight to power a turbine. SETO is developing next generation CSP technologies (Gen3 CSP) which aim to deliver heat to a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)-based turbine at or above 700 °C. The Gen3 CSP program [2] identified several heat transfer media (HTM) that showed promise in meeting SETO’s electricity cost goals of $0.05/kWh. The program was then organized by the phase of matter for leading HTM— gas, liquid, or solid. Released in 2017, the Gen3 Roadmap study describes the best understanding of potential Gen3 technologies [3]. Since 2017, additional relevant research and analysis has entered the public domain [4-8].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the candidate Gen3 CSP thermal transport systems are based on:\r\n\r\n·         Chloride salt blends. A mixture of magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (MgCl2-NaCl-KCl) is a leading salt-based HTM candidate for Gen3. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include catastrophic corrosion in the presence of oxygen or moisture, low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum thermal flux on the leading nickel alloy receivers, and freeze risk. The Gen3 liquid-phase team has determined that a liquid sodium receiver is ultimately less risky than a chloride salt receiver with technologies presently available, however, this salt remains the leading choice of the Gen3 team to transport energy up and down a tower and to act as the thermal energy storage (TES) medium.\r\n\r\n·         Supercritical fluids. Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) has been considered as a HTM for the Gen3 gas phase system. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include: high-pressure and low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum allowable flux on nickel alloy receivers; high parasitic losses in circulation greatly impacted by pressure drop in the receiver; creep and fatigue failure of the receiver; and, a higher receiver outlet temperature needed for additional temperature drops in indirect thermal energy storage systems (such as particle beds).\r\n\r\n·         Particles. Sand-like particles may avoid many of the issues associated with fluid high temperature systems due to the ability to operate at ambient pressure and with limited corrosion or thermal stability risk. Challenges include: operability limitations; risk of particle degradation with time at temperature; scaling limitations; efficiency of heat exchange in the receiver and primary heater; and general challenges in particle transport and mass flow control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo further develop Gen3 CSP systems and ensure their feasibility in the market, there is a need to design, build and test Gen3 system components that will be economically viable in future Gen3 plants. Applicants are expected to include the design, feasibility, and cost validation of new or improved components and subsystems during their Phase I application; lab scale testing, and prototype manufacturing of such components is of interest in Phase II applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following are specific components that are of interest for development and desired performance parameters that would be supported under this subtopic: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComponents \r\n\r\n·         Receivers:\r\n\r\no   Thermal efficiency > 90%.\r\n\r\no   Cost < 75 $/kWth (receiver only; excludes tower and piping).\r\n\r\no   Total receiver system cost including tower, piping, and cold salt pump < 150 $/kWth.\r\n\r\no   Lifetime > 10,000 cycles.\r\n\r\no   Applicable to gas, particle, or molten salt operation at >750°C.\r\n\r\n·         Hot and cold salt pumps:\r\n\r\no   Designed for 720°C operation.\r\n\r\no   Operating power less than 5% of plant annual output.

Affordability, Reliability, and Performance of Solar Technologies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals for solutions that can advance solar energy technologies by lowering cost [1] and facilitate the secure integration into the Nation’s energy grid.

In the past few years, SETO has funded several programs to support multi-stakeholder teams as they research and develop solutions to reduce significant barriers to solar energy adoption through innovative models, technologies, and real-world data sets. The areas of interest, analysis, taxonomies, and best practices developed from these programs can be leveraged as the impetus for small-business innovation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must include a clear assessment of the state of the art and how the proposed technology would represent a significant improvement, along with a basic cost-model analysis showing a path to becoming cost-competitive with current state of the art and the potential to increase solar generation on the grid.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they are not based on sound scientific principles, are within the scope of any other of the subtopic listed under the Solar Energy Technologies topic, or do any of the following:\r\n\r\n·         Focus exclusively on HVAC or water heating applications;\r\n\r\n·         Propose development of concentrated PV or solar spectrum splitting technologies;\r\n\r\n·         Propose development of technologies with very low possibility of being manufactured domestically at a competitive cost (e.g., PV modules based on copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) or amorphous silicon thin films; technologies assuming incorporation of functional materials, such as quantum dots or luminescent solar concentrators);\r\n\r\n·         Propose technologies to improve the shade tolerance of PV modules;\r\n\r\n·         Business plans or proofs of concept that do not include documentation supporting their necessity or benefit.

"subtopic_description": "a.      TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Method for Mechanical Load Testing of Photovoltaic\r\nModules with Concurrently Applied Stressors and Diagnostic Methods\r\n\r\nThis is a Technology Transfer\r\nOpportunity for a non-exclusive license to commercialize a newly developed and\r\nPV module testing platform that allows for simultaneous application of multiple\r\nstress factors of the natural environment. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComprehensive design testing of PV\r\nmodules is challenging. Typically, stresses at levels higher than those\r\noccurring in the natural environment are applied to achieve acceleration. These\r\nstress factors are usually applied in steady state, with fewer stress factors,\r\nor in combinations and sequences that do not reflect real world conditions. \r\nAlso, stress tests are frequently designed around failure modes in existing\r\ndesigns that have already manifested in the field, limiting our ability to\r\npredict the potential occurrence of failures with new PV module materials and\r\ndesigns. Real-world load tests – required for modules in environments in which\r\nhigh wind or snow loading is commonplace – are difficult to replicate because\r\ncurrently used techniques cannot replicate the high frequency module vibration\r\nexperienced in high winds while also thermally stressing the module, allowing\r\nfor water ingress, and allowing exposure to light. Current methods for applying\r\nmechanical load to a module for mechanical testing obstruct significant amount\r\nof light from at least one side of the module whereas open rack systems,\r\nespecially for bifacial modules, are designed for exposure to light from both\r\nfaces of the module. While each of the stress factors are frequently applied in\r\nisolation, no current test for full size commercial PV modules can replicate\r\nthe combination of stress factors as occurs in the natural environment in which\r\nthey have been known unexpectedly fail, in part because of the limitation of\r\ncommonly used stress tests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Renewable Energy\r\nLaboratory (NREL) has developed a PV module testing platform to simultaneously\r\napply multiple stress factors of the natural environment (light, heat,\r\nmoisture, system voltage, and mechanical stress) to achieve a comprehensive\r\ntest of module durability. The simulation applies levels corresponding to the\r\nextremes of the conditions found in the natural environment using a four-cell\r\nmini module platform. We seek the scale up and commercialization of a system\r\nfor full size modules with these five stress factors, including a system that\r\napplies an oscillating mechanical load to the edges of a PV module in such a way\r\nso as to avoid obstructing the active cell area.  To achieve this, the module\r\ncan be vibrated at its mounting points so that the interior of the module is\r\nrapidly displaced by its own momentum. Avoiding the obstruction of light this\r\nway, additional stressors including light, heat, moisture would be\r\nsimultaneously applied the active area of the module such that they me be\r\nmonitored by optical or electro-optical means to evaluate any module\r\ndegradation in-situ. NREL is currently looking for partners to help with\r\nprototyping and commercialization of the combined- accelerated stress testing\r\nsystem for the evaluation of durability of full-size commercial PV modules.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNational Renewable Energy\r\nLaboratory Information: \r\n\r\nLicensing Information: National\r\nRenewable Energy Laboratory \r\n\r\nContact: Bill Hadley; bill.hadley@nrel.gov; (303) 275 3015\r\n\r\nLicense type: Non-Exclusive \r\n\r\nPatent Status: Pending\r\n\r\nNREL tracking number:  19-64\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: solar.sbir@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n ",

TECHNOLOGY\r\nTRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Nanocomposite Barrier Films for Photovoltaic Applications\r\n\r\nThis Technology Transfer\r\nOpportunity solicits interested companies to license a newly developed and\r\npatented thin film coating that can be used as an encapsulant for photovoltaic\r\nmodule assemblies and barrier coating in other photovoltaic applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPolymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN)\r\nthin film coatings have improved water vapor and oxygen permeability, in\r\naddition to improved corrosion resistance, while retaining high transparency,\r\nhigh electrical resistivity, and excellent fire-retardant properties for use as\r\nencapsulants for photovoltaic module assemblies and barrier coatings in other\r\nphotovoltaic applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn these unique composite\r\nmaterials, repeated sequential deposition of solutions of clays (vermiculite,\r\nmontmorillonite, etc.) and solutions of polymers (polyethylenimine,\r\n poly(acrylic acid, etc.) layer with complimentary charged functional\r\ngroups (positive and negative) forms a coating.  The coating can be\r\ndeposited with many various repeating schemes as it is built one layer at a\r\ntime. Once cured, the microstructure resembles a brick and mortar system where\r\nthe clay platelets are the “bricks” and the polymer is the ”mortar”. The facile\r\nand scalable layer-by-layer processing is applicable to many substrates, from\r\nporous and flexible items such as fabrics and foams to hard dense materials\r\nsuch as glass or ceramics.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs an impermeable barrier, the\r\nstructure dictates a tortuous path for oxygen or water molecules to follow,\r\nwhich decreases the water transmission rate by over an order of magnitude\r\nbeyond ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). During a fire, the applied composite coating\r\nreduces the heat rate release, and can act as a flame retardant system.

Floating\r\nSolar-Powered Aeration Systems\r\n\r\nIn this subtopic, SETO seeks\r\ninnovations that can advance the application of floating solar-powered aeration\r\nsystems (FSAS) to improve water quality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAeration is the introduction of\r\nair into aquatic systems to support the growth of aerobic bacteria and aquatic\r\nlife. Facilitating the oxidative decomposition of biological materials,\r\naeration can also remove the gaseous products of decomposition, including\r\nammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Many natural systems\r\ndepend upon aeration to maintain a diversity of animal and plant species, as\r\nwell as overall health. However, a surplus of nutrients, restricted mixing and\r\nflow, or significant depth can deplete dissolved oxygen in aqueous systems [1,\r\n2].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArtificial aeration has been\r\ndeveloped to address this issue. As a technology, aeration is generally applied\r\nto establish, maintain, or restore sufficient dissolved oxygen to ensure\r\nsuccessful remediation and protection of water resources, including natural\r\nbodies of water (e.g., rivers, lakes) and artificial ones (e.g., fish farms,\r\nlagoons) [2]. Recently, self-powered, autonomous units that combine floating\r\nphotovoltaics and aeration have been implemented to help restore natural water\r\nresources. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications should fall within\r\none of the following three broad areas for ecosystem management on water\r\nsystems: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for environmental restoration and protection of natural\r\nwater systems [1, 2]; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for sustainable water systems for aquaculture [3]; \r\n\r\n·        \r\nFSAS for sustainable waste bio-processing water systems [4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications for FSAS outside\r\nthese three categories will be considered if they focus on aeration via a\r\nfloating solar-powered system.

Infrastructure systems, including the\r\nelectrical grid and solar generation assets, are vulnerable to weather-related\r\nthreats, cyberattacks, and other disruptive events.

Innovation\r\nin Solar Aesthetics for Residential Photovoltaic Systems\r\n\r\nThis\r\nsubtopic solicits proposals for technologies that improve the aesthetic appeal\r\nof photovoltaic systems for use in residential applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile the PV market has continued\r\nto expand rapidly, the rooftop residential market has not grown at the same\r\npace as the utility PV market, as a percentage of added capacity [1]. A survey\r\nof solar installers reported 40% of them consider aesthetics to be key when\r\nrecommending which panels to install [2]. An NREL survey of potential adopters\r\nfound that approximately 30% of people stopped considering PV installations due\r\nto concerns about aesthetics or the impact on the home’s resale value [3].\r\nAnother survey, of residential customers, found customers do not find currently\r\navailable solar products attractive, ranking appearance a priority above\r\nreliability but below efficiency and price [4]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the installed\r\ncost per watt has remained high, mainly owing to the slower reduction in\r\nnon-hardware costs for this segment of the market.

"subtopic_description": "h.      Components\r\nfor Gen3 CSP Thermal Transport Systems\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Energy Storage\r\nGrand Challenge [1], this subtopic seeks proposals for the design of components\r\nfor the next generation of Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP) generation\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCSP technologies can be used to\r\ngenerate electricity by converting energy from sunlight to power a turbine.\r\nSETO is developing next generation CSP technologies (Gen3 CSP) which aim to\r\ndeliver heat to a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)-based turbine at or above\r\n700 °C. The Gen3 CSP program [2] identified several heat transfer media (HTM)\r\nthat showed promise in meeting SETO’s electricity cost goals of $0.05/kWh. The\r\nprogram was then organized by the phase of matter for leading HTM— gas, liquid,\r\nor solid. Released in 2017, the Gen3 Roadmap study describes the best\r\nunderstanding of potential Gen3 technologies [3]. Since 2017, additional relevant\r\nresearch and analysis has entered the public domain [4-8]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the candidate\r\nGen3 CSP thermal transport systems are based on:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nChloride salt blends. A mixture of magnesium\r\nchloride, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride (MgCl2-NaCl-KCl) is a leading\r\nsalt-based HTM candidate for Gen3. Major impediments to Gen3 paradigms using\r\nthis HTM in the receiver include catastrophic corrosion in the presence of\r\noxygen or moisture, low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum thermal flux\r\non the leading nickel alloy receivers, and freeze risk. The Gen3 liquid-phase\r\nteam has determined that a liquid sodium receiver is ultimately less risky than\r\na chloride salt receiver with technologies presently available, however, this\r\nsalt remains the leading choice of the Gen3 team to transport energy up and\r\ndown a tower and to act as the thermal energy storage (TES) medium.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nSupercritical fluids. Supercritical carbon\r\ndioxide (sCO2) has been considered as a HTM for the Gen3 gas phase system.\r\nMajor impediments to Gen3 paradigms using this HTM in the receiver include:\r\nhigh-pressure and low thermal conductivity limiting the maximum allowable flux\r\non nickel alloy receivers; high parasitic losses in circulation greatly\r\nimpacted by pressure drop in the receiver; creep and fatigue failure of the\r\nreceiver; and, a higher receiver outlet temperature needed for additional\r\ntemperature drops in indirect thermal energy storage systems (such as particle\r\nbeds). \r\n\r\n·        \r\nParticles. Sand-like particles may avoid\r\nmany of the issues associated with fluid high temperature systems due to the\r\nability to operate at ambient pressure and with limited corrosion or thermal\r\nstability risk. Challenges include: operability limitations; risk of particle\r\ndegradation with time at temperature; scaling limitations; efficiency of heat\r\nexchange in the receiver and primary heater; and general challenges in particle\r\ntransport and mass flow control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo further develop Gen3 CSP\r\nsystems and ensure their feasibility in the market, there is a need to design,\r\nbuild and test Gen3 system components that will be economically viable in\r\nfuture Gen3 plants.

Game\r\nChanging Technologies for Polymer Composites\r\n\r\nIn support of DOE’s Plastics\r\nInnovation Challenge, this subtopic encourages the submission of proposals for\r\ninnovations in polymer composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer\r\ncomposites that have the potential to provide the most significant weight\r\nsavings (up to 60-70%), while offering high specific strength, high specific\r\nstiffness, and excellent chemical/corrosion resistance which are important in a\r\nvehicle operational environment.  Enabling the use of lightweight materials\r\nacross the automotive industry through the development of novel materials,\r\ncomposite preforms and intermediates, manufacturing processes, and components\r\nfor high-volume, high-performance, and affordable polymer composite vehicle\r\napplications is a key enabler for increasing fuel economy and reducing the\r\nenvironmental impact of vehicles. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest within this\r\nsubtopic are as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Multiscale reinforced\r\nlightweight polymer composites: Polymer composites often rely on employing\r\nreinforcements such as micro- or nano-fillers in a relatively soft\r\nmatrix. Simply using a single type of reinforcement (either micro- or\r\nnano-fillers) in polymer composites has almost achieved its reinforcing\r\nlimit.  Multiscale micro/nano hybrid reinforcements are anticipated to\r\nachieve exceptional reinforcing effects, which are beyond the reach of a single\r\ntype of reinforcement. Such hierarchical hybrid fillers are expected to enhance\r\nthe filler/matrix interfacial load transfer.  However, simultaneously\r\nadding both micro- and nano-reinforcements in a polymer matrix material remains\r\nchallenging since nano-fillers tend to loosely adhere (agglomerate) onto\r\nmicro-fillers, decreasing their reinforcing effects [1]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to achieve multiscale (both micro- and nanoscale)\r\nreinforcing effects simultaneously in the polymer matrix. \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of new kinds of fillers with both micro- and\r\nnano-characteristics enabling multiscale reinforcing mechanisms in polymer\r\ncomposites.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Nano-additive enabled\r\nupcycling of polymer composites: Polymer composite vehicle structures/parts\r\nare required to be recycled for reuse.  Converting polymer composites into\r\na value-added product will significantly reduce the amount of plastic that\r\nbecomes landfill or environmental pollution. The recycled composites often\r\nexhibit degradation in both properties and functionalities. Upcycling is\r\nneeded to restore the recycled composites to achieve the same or even superior\r\nproperties and functionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts\r\n[2]. Nano-additives are anticipated to offer an intriguing upcycling\r\nopportunity through reinforcing matrix and/or tailoring filler/matrix interface\r\nto achieve a higher load-transfer efficiency. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nTechnologies to upcycle polymer composites by adding low-cost\r\nnano-fillers in recycled composites.  \r\n\r\n·        \r\nDevelopment of low-cost nano-additives capable of restoring\r\nrecycled composites to achieve the same or even superior properties and\r\nfunctionalities over the pristine polymer composite counterparts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProposals must tie in with\r\nstructural polymer composites that have advantages of low cost, lightweight,\r\nand high performance for vehicle applications. Any proposals using above\r\ntechnologies to develop or improve battery materials performance will not be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Felix Wu, felix.wu@ee.doe.gov \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nd.      Reliable,\r\nDurable, Low-Cost Sensors for Advanced Combustion and Emission Control\r\nStrategies\r\n\r\nThis subtopic solicits proposals\r\nto develop sensors for engine combustion and after treatment systems that offer\r\na significant decrease in cost while demonstrating durability, as well as improved\r\nspeed and accuracy that enable new combustion strategies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdvanced combustion engines that\r\nincrease fuel economy while meeting increasingly stringent emission regulations\r\nwill require innovative control strategies. Such control strategies need a\r\nvariety of accurate and timely inputs. Sensors which measure important inputs\r\nlike temperature, pressure, fuel-air ratio, fuel quality, and piston and valve\r\nposition, as well as reliably detect pollutants at all operating conditions\r\nwould be installed on future engines and used for combustion control and active\r\nfeedback. While various sensor options are currently available, significant\r\nreductions in cost and increased durability are needed to be widely\r\nimplemented. In some cases, improvements in speed and accuracy of sensor\r\nmeasurements are desired to enable real-time adjustments of engine operation\r\nthat would facilitate further efficiency improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCombustion strategies that operate\r\nfuel-lean offer superior fuel efficiency, but require complex exhaust gas after\r\ntreatment systems, including particulate filters and selective catalytic\r\nreduction (SCR) catalysts using injected urea solution, to comply with emission\r\nregulations. Currently, back pressure sensors are employed in conjunction with\r\ncontrol maps to identify when regeneration (soot oxidation) of particulate\r\nfilters is needed, but more advanced sensors may enable reducing the\r\nregeneration frequency and/or shortening the length of the process (reducing\r\nfuel penalty). Real-time sensors for direct measurement of exhaust oxides of\r\nnitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) and for ammonia (NH3), are lacking.\r\nAdoption of low NOx and PM regulation will further challenge measurement of\r\nthese ultra-low pollutants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must demonstrate:\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAn understanding of the current state-of-the-art (SOA) in\r\nautomotive sensors.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nWhy the proposed technology represents significant improvement in\r\nthe SOA with respect to cost, accuracy, durability, or other important\r\nparameters.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEvidence, or a plan to demonstrate, that the sensor will work\r\nreliably for the typical lifetime of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEvidence that the proposed sensor technology once installed in\r\nengines and after treatment systems will facilitate fuel efficiency\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nEvidence that the sensor is likely to be successfully installed\r\non a modern, production automotive engine in Phase II.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Michael\r\nWeismiller, michael.weismiller@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic a:\r\n\r\n1.     \r\n“Energy Storage System Goals.” United States Council for Automotive\r\nResearch, LLC., 2020, http://www.uscar.org/guest/article_view.php?articles_id=85\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.     \r\n“USABC Manuals.” United States Council for Automotive Research, LLC. www.uscar.org/guest/article_view.php?articles_id=86\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences: Subtopic b: \r\n\r\n1.     \r\nDepartment of the Interior. “Final List of Critical Minerals 2018,” 83\r\nFed.

Electric\r\nDrive Vehicle Batteries\r\n\r\nThis subtopic seeks applications\r\nfor research to develop electrochemical energy storage technologies that\r\nsupport commercialization of micro, mild, and full Hybrid Electric Vehicles\r\n(HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome specific improvements of\r\ninterest to be considered in this subtopic include the following: \r\n\r\n·        \r\nNew low-cost materials for HEVs, PHEVs, and EVs.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nAlternatives to or recycling technologies for critical materials [1]\r\nfor energy storage. \r\n\r\n·        \r\nHigh voltage and high temperature non-carbonate electrolytes.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nImprovements in manufacturing processes, specifically the\r\nproduction of mixed metal oxide cathode materials through the elimination or\r\noptimization of the calcination step to reduce cost and improve throughput,\r\nspeed, or yield.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nNovel Solid Electrolyte Interphase stabilization techniques for\r\nsilicon anodes. \r\n\r\n·        \r\nImproved cell/pack design minimizing inactive material.\r\n\r\n·        \r\nSignificant improvement in specific energy (Wh/kg) or energy\r\ndensity (Wh/L); and improved safety. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications must clearly\r\ndemonstrate how they advance the current state of the art in electric drive\r\nvehicle batteries and meet the relevant performance metrics listed at www.uscar.org/guest/article_view.php?articles_id=85\r\n[2]. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen appropriate, the technology\r\nshould be evaluated in accordance with applicable test procedures or\r\nrecommended practices as published by DOE and the U.S. Advanced Battery\r\nConsortium (USABC). These test procedures can be found at www.uscar.org/guest/article_view.php?articles_id=86\r\n[3]. \r\n\r\nPhase I feasibility studies must\r\nbe evaluated in full cells (not half-cells) greater than 200 milliamp-hours\r\n(mAh) in size while Phase II technologies should be demonstrated in full cells\r\ngreater than 2 Ah. \r\n\r\nApplications will be deemed\r\nnon-responsive if the proposed technology is high cost; requires substantial\r\ninfrastructure investments or industry standardization to be commercially\r\nviable; and/or cannot accept high power recharge pulses from regenerative\r\nbreaking or has other characteristics that prohibit market penetration.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch sought through this\r\nsubtopic supports DOE’s Energy Storage Grand Challenge, a comprehensive program\r\nto accelerate the development, commercialization, and utilization of\r\nnext-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global\r\nleadership in energy storage. In addition, the subtopic supports for the\r\nobjectives of the Critical Minerals Initiative to reduce both the costs of\r\ncritical materials and the environmental impacts of production to create a\r\nsustainable critical-materials supply chain in the United States. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuestions – Contact: Simon\r\nThompson, Simon.Thompson@ee.doe.gov\r\n\r\n ",
